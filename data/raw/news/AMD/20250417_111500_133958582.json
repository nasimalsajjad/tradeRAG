    "summary": "Buying and holding solid stocks for a long time is a tried-and-tested way of making money in the stock market, as this strategy helps investors capitalize on secular growth opportunities and disruptive trends while also allowing them to benefit from the power of compounding.  This explains why an investment of $1,000 in shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) a decade ago would now be worth more than $33,500.
