Though AMD's plans predate U.S. President Donald Trump's return to office, tech companies' efforts to diversify their supply chains have taken on added significance given Trump's escalating tariff war.  \"Our new fifth-generation EPYC is doing very well, so we're ready to start production,\" AMD Chief Executive Lisa Su told reporters in Taipei, referring to the company's central processing unit (CPU) for data centres.",
