    "summary": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has now filled out its lineup of Blackwell-based gaming graphics cards with the unveiling of the RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti.  AMD launched higher-end graphics cards as part of its RX 9000 series last month, and mainstream cards are likely to come soon.  Nvidia is getting somewhat aggressive on pricing with the RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti, which makes sense, given the competitive environment.",
