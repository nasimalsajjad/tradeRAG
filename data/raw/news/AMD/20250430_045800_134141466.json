    "summary": "The negative stock market sentiment has weighed on shares of AMD and Nvidia this year.  The PHLX Semiconductor Sector index has been under duress this year and lost over 14% of its value thanks to the tariff-fueled economic uncertainty that has raised the potential of a global recession, which explains why some of the major names in this sector have performed poorly on the stock market in 2025.  Shares of both Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) are down close to 20% so far this year.",
