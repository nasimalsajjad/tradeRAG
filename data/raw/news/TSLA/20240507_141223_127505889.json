    "summary": "U.S. stock indexes rose on Tuesday, on track for a fourth straight positive session fueled by renewed expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year, despite declines in Walt Disney shares weighing on overall market gains.  Walt Disney fell 9.8%, on track for its biggest percentage fall since November 2022, as a surprise profit in its streaming entertainment division was eclipsed by a drop in its traditional TV business and weaker box office.  Despite Disney's drag, the three main U.S. stock indexes were trading at a more than three week high after a weaker-than-expected labor market report last week fueled bets that the U.S. central bank will cut rates.",
