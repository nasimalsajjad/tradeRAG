    "summary": "The Milken Institute Global Conference is underway in Los Angeles, California. The institute’s Chairman, Michael Milken, sat down with Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to discuss space, artificial intelligence, population growth, and what keeps him up at night. Space (00:00:05) Musk explains that he wants “to be a multi-planet civilization so that we have planetary redundancy, such that no single event can… be the end of our civilization.” AI (00:00:21) “It’s very important to have a maximum truth-seeking AI… and a maximumly curious AI,” Musk notes. While “biological intelligence can serve as a… backstop, as a… buffer of intelligence… almost all intelligence will be digital.” Population Growth (00:00:52) “The more prosperous a civilization and the more a civilization feels that it does need to defend against external threats, the lower the birth rate,” Musk discusses. “You should really think of human civilization as being like a tiny candle in a vast darkness, and we should do everything possible to ensure that… candle does not go out.” For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here.",
