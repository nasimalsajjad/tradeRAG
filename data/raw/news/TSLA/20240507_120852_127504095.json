    "summary": "U.S. stock indexes rose on Tuesday, extending their recent run on expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year, while a drop in Walt Disney shares following quarterly results limited overall market gains.  Walt Disney fell 9.7%, on track for its biggest percentage fall since November 2022, as a surprise profit in its streaming entertainment division was eclipsed by a drop in its traditional TV business and weaker box office.",
