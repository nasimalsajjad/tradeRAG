    "summary": "Futures tracking the S&P 500 and Dow edged higher on Tuesday, ahead of quarterly results from Walt Disney, while expectations of the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts this year helped support market sentiments.  The three main U.S. stock indexes closed at their strongest level in more than three weeks on Monday, after a weaker-than-expected labor market report last week fueled bets that the U.S. central bank will ease monetary policy later this year.",
