    "summary": "The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both clung onto gains to close higher on Tuesday, extending recent winning streaks fueled by renewed expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year.  The advances pushed the S&P 500 to a fourth straight higher close, and its best winning run since March.  For the Dow , it is now on its longest positive run since December 2023, gaining for the fifth session in a row.",
