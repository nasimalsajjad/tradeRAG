    "summary": "Futures tracking U.S. stock indexes were largely muted after Walt Disney slipped following second-quarter results, while expectations of the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts this year lent support to the market.  Walt Disney fell 6.2% in premarket trading, as a surprise profit in its streaming entertainment division was eclipsed by a drop in its traditional TV business and weaker box office.  \"Going forward, we expect the market to turn its focus more on earnings as the volatility around interest rate expectations subsides.\"",
