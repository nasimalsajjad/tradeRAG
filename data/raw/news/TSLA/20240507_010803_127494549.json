    "summary": "China electric vehicle maker Nio has struck a deal with larger rival BYD to source batteries for an EV brand priced at a lower range that aims to compete with Tesla, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.  It also shows the impact of unrelenting competition over the price of new EVs in China's market, and batteries, the largest single cost in a new vehicle.  Nio, which launched as a start-up a decade ago, had intended to produce batteries in-house but abandoned those plans in December as it shifted its focus to cutting costs to reverse losses.",
