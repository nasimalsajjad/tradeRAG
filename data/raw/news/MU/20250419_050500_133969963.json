    "summary": "Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) has been one of the more disappointing stocks in modern market history.  Shares of the veteran chipmaker, which helped pioneer the digital age, are down almost 15% over the last 20 years, as the company missed out on major technology transitions such as mobile and now artificial intelligence (AI), including passing up an opportunity to invest in OpenAI even as recently as in 2017.  Meanwhile, competitors like AMD and Nvidia have soared past Intel, as chip stocks have generally outperformed over the last decade, even as Intel has been a laggard.",
