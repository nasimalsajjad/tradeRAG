    "summary": "Micron's shares fell 8% on Friday, as its dour margin forecast took the shine off a robust quarterly revenue outlook driven by demand for its semiconductors used in artificial intelligence tasks. Micron, one of only three providers of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips for data-intensive generative AI applications, forecast adjusted gross margin below estimates on Thursday, as lower pricing for consumer memory chips hits profitability. After a 1.4% drop in 2024, Micron's shares have gained more than 13% this year as investors bet on improving consumer memory chip pricing and expected the company to benefit from its essential position in AI supply chains.",
