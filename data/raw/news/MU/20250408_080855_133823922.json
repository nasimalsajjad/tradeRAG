    "summary": "U.S. memory chipmaker Micron Technology has told U.S. customers it plans to impose a surcharge on some products from Wednesday to account for U.S. President Donald Trump's new tariffs, four sources familiar with the matter said.  Micron's overseas manufacturing sites are largely based in Asia, including China, Taiwan, Japan, Malaysia and Singapore.  The company notified its customers in a letter that while Trump's announcement last week exempted semiconductors, which account for part of Micron's portfolio, the tariffs applied to memory modules and solid-state drives (SSDs), the sources said.",
