    "summary": "Micron released its latest quarterly report (for the three months ended Feb. 27) on March 20.  The company recorded a massive increase in its top and bottom lines last quarter and crushed Wall Street's expectations handsomely.  What's more, Micron's guidance for the current quarter also exceeded consensus estimates, which was not surprising, as the company is witnessing remarkably strong demand for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) that's deployed in artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.",
