    "summary": "Micron (NASDAQ: MU) hasn't received as much attention as other chip stocks like Nvidia in the artificial intelligence (AI) era, but the memory-chip maker is emerging as one of many winners from the emerging technology.  Revenue in the quarter reached $8.05 billion, up 38% from the quarter a year ago, though it was down slightly on a sequential basis.  Micron's growth is primarily driven by demand for high-bandwidth memory, a key component in AI applications.",
