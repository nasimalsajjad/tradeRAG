BUSINESS Overview We design, develop, manufacture, sell and lease high-performance fully electric vehicles and energy generation and storage systems, and offer services related to our products. We generally sell our products directly to customers, and continue to grow our customer-facing infrastructure through a global network of vehicle service centers, Mobile Service, body shops, Supercharger stations and Destination Chargers to accelerate the widespread adoption of our products. We emphasize performance, attractive styling and the safety of our users and workforce in the design and manufacture of our products and are continuing to develop full self-driving technology for improved safety. We also strive to lower the cost of ownership for our customers through continuous efforts to reduce manufacturing costs and by offering financial and other services tailored to our products. Our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. We believe that this mission, along with our engineering expertise, vertically integrated business model and focus on user experience differentiate us from other companies. Segment Information We operate as two reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage. The automotive segment includes the design, development, manufacturing, sales and leasing of high-performance fully electric vehicles as well as sales of automotive regulatory credits. Additionally, the automotive segment also includes services and other, which includes non-warranty after-sales vehicle services and parts, sales of used vehicles, retail merchandise, paid Supercharging and vehicle insurance revenue. The energy generation and storage segment includes the design, manufacture, installation, sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products and related services and sales of solar energy systems incentives. Our Products and Services Automotive We currently manufacture four different consumer vehicles – the Model 3, Y, S and X. Model 3 is a four-door mid-size sedan that we designed for manufacturability with a base price for mass-market appeal. Model Y is a compact sport utility vehicle (“SUV”) built on the Model 3 platform with seating for up to seven adults. Model S is a four-door full-size sedan and Model X is a mid-size SUV with seating for up to seven adults. Model S and Model X feature the highest performance characteristics and longest ranges that we offer in a sedan and SUV, respectively. In December 2022, we began early production and deliveries of the Tesla Semi, our first commercial electric vehicle. We have also announced several planned electric vehicles to address additional vehicle markets, including specialized consumer electric vehicles in Cybertruck and the new Tesla Roadster. We plan to continue leveraging developments in our proprietary Full Self-Driving (“FSD”), battery cell and other technologies. Energy Generation and Storage Energy Storage Products Powerwall and Megapack are our lithium-ion battery energy storage products. Powerwall is designed to store energy at a home or small commercial facility. Megapack is an energy storage solution for commercial, industrial, utility and energy generation customers, multiple of which may be grouped together to form larger installations of gigawatt hours (“GWh”) or greater capacity. We also continue to develop software capabilities for remotely controlling and dispatching our energy storage systems across a wide range of markets and applications, including through our real-time energy control and optimization platforms. Solar Energy Offerings We sell retrofit solar energy systems to customers and channel partners and also make them available through power purchase agreement (“PPA”) arrangements. We purchase most of the components for our retrofit solar energy systems from multiple sources to ensure competitive pricing and adequate supply. We also design and manufacture certain components for our solar energy products. We sell our Solar Roof, which combines premium glass roof tiles with energy generation, directly to customers, as well as through channel customers. We continue to improve our installation capability and efficiency, including through collaboration with real estate developers and builders on new homes. 4 Technology Automotive Battery and Powertrain Our core vehicle technology competencies include powertrain engineering and manufacturing and our ability to design vehicles that utilize the unique advantages of an electric powertrain. We have designed our proprietary powertrain systems to be adaptable, efficient, reliable and cost-effective while withstanding the rigors of an automotive environment. We offer dual motor powertrain vehicles, which use two electric motors to maximize traction and performance in an all-wheel drive configuration, as well as vehicle powertrain technology featuring three electric motors for further increased performance in certain versions of Model S and Model X and the Tesla Semi. We maintain extensive testing and R&D capabilities for battery cells, packs and systems, and have built an expansive body of knowledge on lithium-ion cell chemistry types and performance characteristics. In order to enable a greater supply of cells for our products with higher energy density at lower costs, we have developed a new proprietary lithium-ion battery cell and improved manufacturing processes. Vehicle Control and Infotainment Software The performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs utilize sophisticated control software. Control systems in our vehicles optimize performance, customize vehicle behavior, manage charging and control all infotainment functions. We develop almost all of this software, including most of the user interfaces, internally and update our vehicles’ software regularly through over-the-air updates. Self-Driving Development and Artificial Intelligence We have expertise in developing technologies, systems and software to enable self-driving vehicles using primarily vision-based technologies. Our FSD Computer runs our neural networks in our vehicles, and we are also developing additional computer hardware to better enable the massive amounts of field data captured by our vehicles to continually train and improve these neural networks for real-world performance. Currently, we offer in our vehicles certain advanced driver assist systems under our Autopilot and FSD options. Although at present the driver is ultimately responsible for controlling the vehicle, our systems provide safety and convenience functionality that relieves drivers of the most tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel much like the system that airplane pilots use, when conditions permit. As with other vehicle systems, we improve these functions in our vehicles over time through over-the-air updates. We intend to establish in the future an autonomous Tesla ride-hailing network, which we expect would also allow us to access a new customer base even as modes of transportation evolve. We are also applying our artificial intelligence learnings from self-driving technology to the field of robotics. For example, in 2022 we previewed Optimus, a robotic humanoid which is controlled by the same AI system. Energy Generation and Storage Energy Storage Products We leverage many of the component-level technologies from our vehicles in our energy storage products. By taking a modular approach to the design of battery systems, we can optimize manufacturing capacity of our energy storage products. Additionally, our expertise in power electronics enables our battery systems to interconnect with electricity grids while providing fast-acting systems for power injection and absorption. We have also developed software to remotely control and dispatch our energy storage systems. Solar Energy Systems We have engineered Solar Roof over numerous iterations to combine aesthetic appeal and durability with power generation. The efficiency of our solar energy products is aided by our own solar inverter, which incorporates our power electronics technologies. We designed both products to integrate with Powerwall. 5 Design and Engineering Automotive We have established significant in-house capabilities in the design and test engineering of electric vehicles and their components and systems. Our team has significant experience in computer-aided design as well as durability, strength and crash test simulations, which reduces the product development time of new models. We have also achieved complex engineering feats in stamping, casting and thermal systems, and developed a method to integrate batteries directly with vehicle body structures without separate battery packs to optimize manufacturability, weight, range and cost characteristics. We are also expanding our manufacturing operations globally while taking action to localize our vehicle designs and production for particular markets, including country-specific market demands and factory optimizations for local workforces. As we increase our capabilities, particularly in the areas of automation, die-making and line-building, we are also making strides in the simulations modeling these capabilities prior to construction. Energy Generation and Storage Our expertise in electrical, mechanical, civil and software engineering allows us to design, engineer, manufacture and install energy generating and storage products and components, including at the residential through utility scale. For example, the modular design of our Megapack utility-scale battery line is intended to significantly reduce the amount of assembly required in the field. We also customize solutions including our energy storage products, solar energy systems and/or Solar Roof for customers to meet their specific needs. Sales and Marketing Historically, we have been able to generate significant media coverage of our company and our products, and we believe we will continue to do so. Such media coverage and word of mouth are the current primary drivers of our sales leads and have helped us achieve sales without traditional advertising and at relatively low marketing costs. Automotive Direct Sales Our vehicle sales channels currently include our website and an international network of company-owned stores. In some jurisdictions, we also have galleries to educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not transact in the sale of vehicles. We believe this infrastructure enables us to better control costs of inventory, manage warranty service and pricing, educate consumers about electric vehicles, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand and obtain rapid customer feedback. We reevaluate our sales strategy both globally and at a location-by-location level from time to time to optimize our sales channels. However, sales of vehicles in the automobile industry tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to volatility from time to time. Used Vehicle Sales Our used vehicle business supports new vehicle sales by integrating the trade-in of a customer’s existing Tesla or non-Tesla vehicle with the sale of a new or used Tesla vehicle. The Tesla and non-Tesla vehicles we acquire as trade-ins are subsequently remarketed, either directly by us or through third parties. We also remarket used Tesla vehicles acquired from other sources including lease returns. Public Charging We have a growing global network of Tesla Superchargers, which are our industrial-grade, high-speed vehicle chargers. Where possible, we co-locate Superchargers with our solar and energy storage systems to reduce costs and promote renewable power. Supercharger stations are typically placed along well-traveled routes and in and around dense city centers to allow vehicle owners the ability to enjoy quick, reliable charging along an extensive network with convenient stops. Use of the Supercharger network either requires payment of a fee or is free under certain sales programs. In November 2021, we began to offer Supercharger access to non-Tesla vehicles in certain locations in support of our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. We also work with a wide variety of hospitality, retail and public destinations, as well as businesses with commuting employees, to offer additional charging options for our customers, as well as single-family homeowners and multi-family residential entities, to deploy home charging solutions. 6 In-App Upgrades As our vehicles are capable of being updated remotely over-the-air, our customers may purchase additional paid options and features through the Tesla app or through the in-vehicle user interface. We expect that this functionality will also allow us to offer certain options and features on a subscription basis in the future. Energy Generation and Storage We market and sell our solar and energy storage products to residential, commercial and industrial customers and utilities through a variety of channels, including through our website, stores and galleries, as well as through our network of channel partners, and in the case of some commercial customers, through PPA transactions. We emphasize simplicity, standardization and accessibility to make it easy and cost-effective for customers to adopt clean energy, while reducing our customer acquisition costs. Service and Warranty Automotive Service We provide service for our electric vehicles at our company-owned service locations and through Tesla Mobile Service technicians who perform work remotely at customers’ homes or other locations. Performing vehicle service ourselves allows us to identify problems and implement solutions and improvements faster, and optimize logistics and inventory better, than traditional automobile manufacturers and their dealer networks. The connectivity of our vehicles also allows us to diagnose and remedy many problems remotely and proactively. Vehicle Limited Warranties and Extended Service Plans We provide a manufacturer’s limited warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles we sell, which may include separate limited warranties on certain components, specific types of damage or battery capacity retention. We also currently offer extended service plans that provide coverage beyond the new vehicle limited warranties for certain models in specified regions. Energy Generation and Storage We provide service and repairs to our energy product customers, including under warranty where applicable. We generally provide manufacturer’s limited warranties with our energy storage products and offer certain extended limited warranties that are available at the time of purchase of the system. If we install a system, we also provide certain limited warranties on our installation workmanship. For retrofit solar energy systems, we provide separate limited warranties for workmanship and against roof leaks, and for Solar Roof, we also provide limited warranties for defects and weatherization. For components not manufactured by us, we generally pass-through the applicable manufacturers’ warranties. As part of our solar energy system and energy storage contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that commit that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or performance requirements specified in the contract. Financial Services Automotive Purchase Financing and Leases We offer leasing and/or loan financing arrangements for our vehicles in certain jurisdictions in North America, Europe and Asia ourselves and through various financial institutions. Under certain of such programs, we have provided resale value guarantees or buyback guarantees that may obligate us to repurchase the subject vehicles at pre-determined values. Insurance In 2021, we launched our insurance product using real-time driving behavior in select states, which offers rates that are often better than other alternatives and promotes safer driving. Our insurance products are currently available in 12 states and we plan to expand the markets in which we offer insurance products, as part of our ongoing effort to decrease the total cost of ownership for our customers. 7 Energy Generation and Storage We offer certain financing options to our solar customers, which enable the customer to purchase and own a solar energy system, Solar Roof or integrated solar and Powerwall system. Our solar PPAs, offered primarily to commercial customers, charge a fee per kilowatt-hour based on the amount of electricity produced by our solar energy systems. Manufacturing We currently have manufacturing facilities in the US in Northern California, in Buffalo, New York, Gigafactory New York; in Austin, Texas, Gigafactory Texas and near Reno, Nevada, Gigafactory Nevada. At these facilities, we manufacture and assemble, among other things, vehicles, certain vehicle parts and components, such as our battery packs and battery cells, energy storage components and solar products and components. Internationally, we also have manufacturing facilities in China (Gigafactory Shanghai) and Germany (Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg), which allows us to increase the affordability of our vehicles for customers in local markets by reducing transportation and manufacturing costs and eliminating the impact of unfavorable tariffs. Generally, we continue to expand production capacity at our existing facilities. We also intend to further increase cost-competitiveness in our significant markets by strategically adding local manufacturing. Supply Chain Our products use thousands of parts that are sourced from hundreds of suppliers across the world. We have developed close relationships with vendors of key parts such as battery cells, electronics and complex vehicle assemblies. Certain components purchased from these suppliers are shared or are similar across many product lines, allowing us to take advantage of pricing efficiencies from economies of scale. As is the case for some automotive companies, some of our procured components and systems are sourced from single suppliers. Where multiple sources are available for certain key components, we work to qualify multiple suppliers for them where it is sensible to do so in order to minimize potential production risks due to disruptions in their supply. We also mitigate risk by maintaining safety stock for key parts and assemblies and die banks for components with lengthy procurement lead times. Our products use various raw materials including aluminum, steel, cobalt, lithium, nickel and copper. Pricing for these materials is governed by market conditions and may fluctuate due to various factors outside of our control, such as supply and demand and market speculation. We strive to execute long-term supply contracts for such materials at competitive pricing when feasible, and we currently believe that we have adequate access to raw materials supplies to meet the needs of our operations. Governmental Programs, Incentives and Regulations Globally, the ownership of our products by our customers is impacted by various government credits, incentives, and policies. Our business and products are also subject to numerous governmental regulations that vary among jurisdictions. The operation of our business is also impacted by various government programs, incentives, and other arrangements. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. Programs and Incentives Inflation Reduction Act On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) was enacted into law and is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022, and remains subject to future guidance releases. The IRA includes multiple incentives to promote clean energy, electric vehicles, battery and energy storage manufacture or purchase, including through providing tax credits to consumers. For example, qualifying Tesla customers may receive up to $7,500 in federal tax credits for the purchase of qualified electric vehicles in the U.S through 2032. Automotive Regulatory Credits We earn tradable credits in the operation of our business under various regulations related to zero-emission vehicles (“ZEVs”), greenhouse gas, fuel economy and clean fuel. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements. Sales of these credits are recognized within automotive regulatory credits revenue in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 8 Energy Storage System Incentives and Policies While the regulatory regime for energy storage projects is still under development, there are various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms at the federal, state and local levels that support the adoption of energy storage. For example, energy storage systems that are charged using solar energy may be eligible for the solar energy-related U.S. federal tax credits described below. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) has also taken steps to enable the participation of energy storage in wholesale energy markets. In addition, California and a number of other states have adopted procurement targets for energy storage, and behind-the-meter energy storage systems qualify for funding under the California Self Generation Incentive Program. Our customers primarily benefit directly under these programs. In certain instances our customers may transfer such credits to us as contract consideration. In such transactions, they are included as a component of energy generation and storage revenues in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Pursuant to the IRA, under Sections 48, 48E and 25D of the Internal Revenue Code (”IRC”), standalone energy storage technology is eligible for a tax credit between 6% and 50% of qualified expenditures, regardless of the source of energy, which may be claimed by our customers for storage systems they purchase or by us for arrangements where we own the systems. These tax credits are primarily for the benefit of our customers and are currently scheduled to phase-out starting in 2032 or later. Solar Energy System Incentives and Policies U.S. federal, state and local governments have established various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms to reduce the cost of solar energy and to accelerate the adoption of solar energy. These incentives include tax credits, cash grants, tax abatements and rebates. In particular, pursuant to the IRA, Sections 48, 48E and 25D of the IRC provides a tax credit between 6% and 70% of qualified commercial or residential expenditures for solar energy systems, which may be claimed by our customers for systems they purchase, or by us for arrangements where we own the systems for properties that meet statutory requirements. These tax credits are primarily for the direct benefit of our customers and are currently scheduled to phase-out starting in 2023 or later. Regulations Vehicle Safety and Testing In the U.S., our vehicles are subject to regulation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”), including all applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (“FMVSS”) and the NHTSA bumper standard. Numerous FMVSS apply to our vehicles, such as crash-worthiness and occupant protection requirements. Our current vehicles fully comply and we expect that our vehicles in the future will fully comply with all applicable FMVSS with limited or no exemptions, however, FMVSS are subject to change from time to time. As a manufacturer, we must self-certify that our vehicles meet all applicable FMVSS and the NHTSA bumper standard, or otherwise are exempt, before the vehicles may be imported or sold in the U.S. We are also required to comply with other federal laws administered by NHTSA, including the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, Theft Prevention Act requirements, labeling requirements and other information provided to customers in writing, Early Warning Reporting requirements regarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports and foreign recalls, a Standing General Order requiring reports regarding crashes involving vehicles equipped with advanced driver assistance systems, and additional requirements for cooperating with compliance and safety investigations and recall reporting. The U.S. Automobile Information and Disclosure Act also requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, optional equipment and pricing. In addition, federal law requires inclusion of fuel economy ratings, as determined by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), and New Car Assessment Program ratings as determined by NHTSA, if available. Our vehicles sold outside of the U.S. are subject to similar foreign compliance, safety, environmental and other regulations. Many of those regulations are different from those applicable in the U.S. and may require redesign and/or retesting. Some of those regulations impact or prevent the rollout of new vehicle features. Additionally, the European Union established new rules regarding additional compliance oversight that commenced in 2020. Self-Driving Vehicles Generally, laws pertaining to self-driving vehicles are evolving globally, and in some cases may create restrictions on features that we develop. While there are currently no federal U.S. regulations pertaining specifically to self-driving vehicles or self-driving equipment, NHTSA has published recommended guidelines on self-driving vehicles, apart from the FMVSS and manufacturer reporting obligations, and retains the authority to investigate and/or take action on the safety or compliance of any vehicle, equipment or features operating on public roads. Certain U.S. states also have legal restrictions on the operation, registration or licensure of self-driving vehicles, and many other states are considering them. This regulatory patchwork increases the legal complexity with respect to self-driving vehicles in the U.S. 9 In markets that follow the regulations of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, some requirements restrict the design of advanced driver-assistance or self-driving features, which can compromise or prevent their use entirely. Other applicable laws, both current and proposed, may hinder the path and timeline to introducing self-driving vehicles for sale and use in the markets where they apply. Other key markets, including China, continue to consider self-driving regulation. Any implemented regulations may differ materially from those in the U.S. and Europe, which may further increase the legal complexity of self-driving vehicles and limit or prevent certain features. Automobile Manufacturer and Dealer Regulation In the U.S., state laws regulate the manufacture, distribution, sale and service of automobiles, and generally require motor vehicle manufacturers and dealers to be licensed in order to sell vehicles directly to residents. Certain states have asserted that the laws in such states do not permit automobile manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer, or that they otherwise restrict a manufacturer’s ability to deliver or perform warranty repairs on vehicles. To sell vehicles to residents of states where we are not licensed as a dealer, we generally conduct the sale out of the state. In certain such states, we have opened “galleries” that serve an educational purpose and where sales may not occur. Some automobile dealer trade associations have both challenged the legality of our operations in court and used administrative and legislative processes to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate existing stores or expand to new locations. Certain dealer associations have also actively lobbied state licensing agencies and legislators to interpret existing laws or enact new laws in ways not favorable to our ownership and operation of our own retail and service locations. We expect such challenges to continue, and we intend to actively fight any such efforts. Battery Safety and Testing Our battery packs are subject to various U.S. and international regulations that govern transport of “dangerous goods,” defined to include lithium-ion batteries, which may present a risk in transportation. We conduct testing to demonstrate our compliance with such regulations. We use lithium-ion cells in our high voltage battery packs in our vehicles and energy storage products. The use, storage and disposal of our battery packs are regulated under existing laws and are the subject of ongoing regulatory changes that may add additional requirements in the future. We have agreements with third party battery recycling companies to recycle our battery packs, and we are also piloting our own recycling technology. Solar Energy—General We are subject to certain state and federal regulations applicable to solar and battery storage providers and sellers of electricity. To operate our systems, we enter into standard interconnection agreements with applicable utilities. Sales of electricity and non-sale equipment leases by third parties, such as our leases and PPAs, have faced regulatory challenges in some states and jurisdictions. Solar Energy—Net Metering Most states in the U.S. make net energy metering, or net metering, available to solar customers. Net metering typically allows solar customers to interconnect their solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit for excess energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid. In certain jurisdictions, regulators or utilities have reduced or eliminated the benefit available under net metering or have proposed to do so. Competition Automotive The worldwide automotive market is highly competitive and we expect it will become even more competitive in the future as we introduce additional vehicles in a broader cross-section of the passenger and commercial vehicle market and expand our vehicles’ capabilities. 10 We believe that our vehicles compete in the market based on both their traditional segment classification as well as their propulsion technology. For example, Model S and Model X compete primarily with premium sedans and premium SUVs and Model 3 and Model Y compete with small to medium-sized sedans and compact SUVs, which are extremely competitive markets. Competing products typically include internal combustion vehicles from more established automobile manufacturers; however, many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles. Overall, we believe these announcements and vehicle introductions, including the introduction of electric vehicles into rental car company fleets, promote the development of the electric vehicle market by highlighting the attractiveness of electric vehicles relative to the internal combustion vehicle. Many major automobile manufacturers have electric vehicles available today in major markets including the U.S., China and Europe, and other current and prospective automobile manufacturers are also developing electric vehicles. In addition, several manufacturers offer hybrid vehicles, including plug-in versions. We believe that there is also increasing competition for our vehicle offerings as a platform for delivering self-driving technologies, charging solutions and other features and services, and we expect to compete in this developing market through continued progress on our Autopilot, FSD and neural network capabilities, Supercharger network and our infotainment offerings. Energy Generation and Storage Energy Storage Systems The market for energy storage products is also highly competitive, and both established and emerging companies have introduced products that are similar to our product portfolio or that are alternatives to the elements of our systems. We compete with these companies based on price, energy density and efficiency. We believe that the specifications and features of our products, our strong brand and the modular, scalable nature of our energy storage products give us a competitive advantage in our markets. Solar Energy Systems The primary competitors to our solar energy business are the traditional local utility companies that supply energy to our potential customers. We compete with these traditional utility companies primarily based on price and the ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by our solar energy systems. We also compete with solar energy companies that provide products and services similar to ours. Many solar energy companies only install solar energy systems, while others only provide financing for these installations. We believe we have a significant expansion opportunity with our offerings and that the regulatory environment is increasingly conducive to the adoption of renewable energy systems. Intellectual Property We place a strong emphasis on our innovative approach and proprietary designs which bring intrinsic value and uniqueness to our product portfolio. As part of our business, we seek to protect the underlying intellectual property rights of these innovations and designs such as with respect to patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other measures, including through employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements. For example, we place a high priority on obtaining patents to provide the broadest and strongest possible protection to enable our freedom to operate our innovations and designs within our products and technologies in the electric vehicle market as well as to protect and defend our product portfolio. We have also adopted a patent policy in which we irrevocably pledged that we will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for infringing our patents through activity relating to electric vehicles or related equipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith. We made this pledge in order to encourage the advancement of a common, rapidly-evolving platform for electric vehicles, thereby benefiting ourselves, other companies making electric vehicles and the world. Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Human Capital Resources ESG The very purpose of Tesla's existence is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. We believe the world cannot reduce carbon emissions without addressing both energy generation and consumption, and we are designing and manufacturing a complete energy and transportation ecosystem to achieve this goal. As we expand, we are building each new factory to be more efficient and sustainably designed than the previous one, including with respect to per-unit waste reduction and resource consumption, including water and energy usage. We are focused on further enhancing sustainability of operations outside of our direct control, including reducing the carbon footprint of our supply chain. 11 We are committed to sourcing only responsibly produced materials, and our suppliers are required to provide evidence of management systems that ensure social, environmental and sustainability best practices in their own operations, as well as to demonstrate a commitment to responsible sourcing into their supply chains. We have a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to child or forced labor and human trafficking by our suppliers and we look to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Due Diligence Guidelines to inform our process and use feedback from our internal and external stakeholders to find ways to continually improve. We are also driving safety in our own factories by focusing on worker engagement. Our incidents per vehicle continue to drop even as our production volumes increase. We also strive to be an employer of choice by offering compelling, impactful jobs with best in-industry benefits. We believe that sound corporate governance is critical to helping us achieve our goals, including with respect to ESG. We continue to evolve a governance framework that exercises appropriate oversight of responsibilities at all levels throughout the company and manages its affairs consistent with high principles of business ethics. Our ESG Sustainability Council is made up of leaders from across our company, and regularly presents to our Board of Directors, which oversees our ESG impacts, initiatives and priorities. Human Capital Resources Our greatest asset is our people and we continue to attract the best and brightest with our competitive pay and benefits package which starts with ownership. We offer employees the opportunity to receive equity during their employment and share in the success of Tesla. As of December 31, 2022, our full-time count for our and our subsidiaries’ employees worldwide was 127,855, a 29,000 year over year increase. We are committed to providing a workplace where our employees feel respected and appreciated. Human Resource (“HR”) Partners for each functional area are introduced in new hire orientation so employees know whom to contact with questions or concerns. HR Partners are visible throughout facilities and are actively involved in driving culture and engagement alongside business leaders. Our policies are designed to promote fairness and respect for everyone. We hire, evaluate, and promote employees based on their skills and performance. Everyone is expected to be trustworthy, demonstrate excellence in their performance, and collaborate with others. With this in mind, we will not tolerate certain behaviors. These include harassment, retaliation, violence, intimidation, and discrimination of any kind on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, disability or veteran status. To ensure this, anti-harassment training is conducted on day one of new hire orientation for all employees. In addition, we run various leadership development programs throughout the year aimed at enhancing leaders’ skills, and in particular, helping them to understand how to appropriately respond to employee concerns. Through our See Something, Say Something program, employees are encouraged to speak up both in regard to misconduct and safety concerns. They can do so by contacting the integrity line, submitting concerns through our Take Charge process, or notifying their HR Partner or any member of management. Concerns are reviewed in accordance with established protocols by investigators with expertise, who also review for trends and outcomes for remediation and appropriate controls. Responding to questions timely is key so we implemented HR Answer Bars in the factories where employees can easily access and speak with an HR representative immediately regarding career advice, benefits or any concerns the employee may have. We have also implemented an HR Chatbot for 24x7 answers to team members’ questions. 12 To continue innovating and changing the world for the better, we must ensure we have a talented and engaged workforce with ample opportunity to contribute to our mission and grow professionally. We are focused on intentionally creating pathways to career opportunities across Tesla through strategic initiatives such as: • Internships and Apprenticeships - Over 3,000 university and community college students from around the world are hired into internship and apprenticeship opportunities at Tesla annually. We recruit from over 100 collegiate institutions and diverse student organizations, attracting top talent passionate about accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy. • Tesla START - Tesla START is an intensive training program providing individuals with the skills necessary for a successful technician role at Tesla. We partner with 13 colleges across the country to integrate Tesla START into automotive, collision and manufacturing curriculums to provide individuals with a smooth transition from college to full-time employment. In 2022, we had over 200 graduates from Tesla START programs, with an additional 100+ graduating in the coming weeks from our winter classes. • High School Graduate Pathways - Tesla's Manufacturing Development Program is designed to provide graduating high school seniors with the financial resources, coursework and experience they need to start a successful manufacturing career at Tesla. We hired 144 graduates through this program in 2022, and our goal in 2023 is to grow this program 2.5X to over 360 students annually across our Fremont Factory, Gigafactory Nevada, Gigafactory Texas, and Gigafactory New York. At Tesla, our employees show up passionate about making a difference in the world and for each other. With a majority-minority workforce, empowering our employee resource groups to take charge in driving initiatives that attract, develop and retain our passionate workforce is vital to our continued success.

RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this report, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and future results. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. Risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Risks Related to Our Ability to Grow Our Business We may be impacted by macroeconomic conditions resulting from the global COVID-19 pandemic. Since the first quarter of 2020, there has been a worldwide impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Government regulations and shifting social behaviors have, at times, limited or closed non-essential transportation, government functions, business activities and person-to-person interactions. Global trade conditions and consumer trends that originated during the pandemic continue to persist and may also have long-lasting adverse impact on us and our industries independently of the progress of the pandemic. For example, pandemic-related issues have exacerbated port congestion and intermittent supplier shutdowns and delays, resulting in additional expenses to expedite delivery of critical parts. Similarly, increased demand for personal electronics has created a shortfall of semiconductors, which has caused challenges in our supply chain and production. In addition, labor shortages resulting from the pandemic, including worker absenteeism, has led to increased difficulty in hiring and retaining manufacturing and service workers, as well as increased labor costs and supplier delays. Sustaining our production trajectory will require the ongoing readiness and solvency of our suppliers and vendors, a stable and motivated production workforce and government cooperation, including for travel and visa allowances. The contingencies inherent in the ramp at new facilities such as Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas may be exacerbated by these challenges. Additionally, infection rates and regulations continue to fluctuate in various regions, which may impact operations. For example, in 2022, spikes in COVID-19 cases in Shanghai resulted in the temporary shutdown of Gigafactory Shanghai, as well as parts of our supply chain, and impacted our ability to deliver cars. We cannot predict the duration or direction of current global trends or their sustained impact. Ultimately, we continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as appropriate, and attempt to accurately project demand and infrastructure requirements globally and deploy our production, workforce and other resources accordingly. Lastly, rising interest rates may lead to consumers to increasingly pull back spending, including on our products, which may harm our demand, business and operating results. If we experience unfavorable global market conditions, or if we cannot or do not maintain operations at a scope that is commensurate with such conditions or are later required to or choose to suspend such operations again, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results may be harmed. We may experience delays in launching and ramping the production of our products and features, or we may be unable to control our manufacturing costs. We have previously experienced and may in the future experience launch and production ramp delays for new products and features. For example, we encountered unanticipated supplier issues that led to delays during the initial ramp of our first Model X and experienced challenges with a supplier and with ramping full automation for certain of our initial Model 3 manufacturing processes. In 14 addition, we may introduce in the future new or unique manufacturing processes and design features for our products. There is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully and timely introduce and scale such processes or features. In particular, our future business depends in large part on increasing the production of mass-market vehicles including Model 3 and Model Y. In order to be successful, we will need to implement, maintain and ramp efficient and cost-effective manufacturing capabilities, processes and supply chains and achieve the design tolerances, high quality and output rates we have planned at our manufacturing facilities in California, Nevada, Texas, China, Germany and any future sites. We will also need to hire, train and compensate skilled employees to operate these facilities. Bottlenecks and other unexpected challenges such as those we experienced in the past may arise during our production ramps, and we must address them promptly while continuing to improve manufacturing processes and reducing costs. If we are not successful in achieving these goals, we could face delays in establishing and/or sustaining our Model 3 and Model Y ramps or be unable to meet our related cost and profitability targets. We have experienced, and may also experience similar future delays in launching and/or ramping production of our energy storage products and Solar Roof; new product versions or variants; new vehicles; and future features and services based on artificial intelligence. Likewise, we may encounter delays with the design, construction and regulatory or other approvals necessary to build and bring online future manufacturing facilities and products. Any delay or other complication in ramping the production of our current products or the development, manufacture, launch and production ramp of our future products, features and services, or in doing so cost-effectively and with high quality, may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Our suppliers may fail to deliver components according to schedules, prices, quality and volumes that are acceptable to us, or we may be unable to manage these components effectively. Our products contain thousands of parts purchased globally from hundreds of suppliers, including single-source direct suppliers, which exposes us to multiple potential sources of component shortages. Unexpected changes in business conditions, materials pricing, including inflation of raw material costs, labor issues, wars, trade policies, natural disasters, health epidemics such as the global COVID-19 pandemic, trade and shipping disruptions, port congestions and other factors beyond our or our suppliers’ control could also affect these suppliers’ ability to deliver components to us or to remain solvent and operational. For example, a global shortage of semiconductors has been reported since early 2021 and has caused challenges in the manufacturing industry and impacted our supply chain and production. In addition, a spike in COVID-19 cases in Shanghai in early 2022 led to temporary manufacturing shutdowns of certain of our suppliers. We have used alternative parts and programmed software to mitigate certain challenges caused by these shortages, but there is no guarantee we may be able to continually do so as we scale production to meet our growth targets. Additionally, if our suppliers do not accurately forecast and effectively allocate production or if they are not willing to allocate sufficient production to us, it may reduce our access to components and require us to search for new suppliers. The unavailability of any component or supplier could result in production delays, idle manufacturing facilities, product design changes and loss of access to important technology and tools for producing and supporting our products, as well as impact our capacity expansion and our ability to fulfill our obligations under customer contracts. Moreover, significant increases in our production, such as for Model 3 and Model Y, or product design changes by us have required and may in the future require us to procure additional components in a short amount of time. We have faced in the past, and may face suppliers who are unwilling or unable to sustainably meet our timelines or our cost, quality and volume needs, or to do so may cost us more, which may require us to replace them with other sources. Finally, we have limited vehicle manufacturing experience outside of the Fremont Factory and Gigafactory Shanghai and we may experience issues increasing the level of localized procurement at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas. While we believe that we will be able to secure additional or alternate sources or develop our own replacements for most of our components, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so quickly or at all. Additionally, we may be unsuccessful in our continuous efforts to negotiate with existing suppliers to obtain cost reductions and avoid unfavorable changes to terms, source less expensive suppliers for certain parts and redesign certain parts to make them less expensive to produce, especially in light of the increases in materials pricing. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. As the scale of our vehicle production increases, we will also need to accurately forecast, purchase, warehouse and transport components at high volumes to our manufacturing facilities and servicing locations internationally. If we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantities of component purchases to our actual needs or successfully implement automation, inventory 15 management and other systems to accommodate the increased complexity in our supply chain and parts management, we may incur unexpected production disruption, storage, transportation and write-off costs, which may harm our business and operating results. We may be unable to meet our projected construction timelines, costs and production ramps at new factories, or we may experience difficulties in generating and maintaining demand for products manufactured there. Our ability to increase production of our vehicles on a sustained basis, make them affordable globally by accessing local supply chains and workforces and streamline delivery logistics is dependent on the construction and ramp of our current and future factories. The construction of and commencement and ramp of production at these factories are subject to a number of uncertainties inherent in all new manufacturing operations, including ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements, procurement and maintenance of construction, environmental and operational licenses and approvals for additional expansion, supply chain constraints, hiring, training and retention of qualified employees and the pace of bringing production equipment and processes online with the capability to manufacture high-quality units at scale. Moreover, we will have to establish and ramp production of our proprietary battery cells and packs at our new factories, and we additionally intend to incorporate sequential design and manufacturing changes into vehicles manufactured at each new factory. If we experience any issues or delays in meeting our projected timelines, costs, capital efficiency and production capacity for our new factories, expanding and managing teams to implement iterative design and production changes there, maintaining and complying with the terms of any debt financing that we obtain to fund them or generating and maintaining demand for the vehicles we manufacture there, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition may be harmed. We may be unable to grow our global product sales, delivery and installation capabilities and our servicing and vehicle charging networks, or we may be unable to accurately project and effectively manage our growth. Our success will depend on our ability to continue to expand our sales capabilities. We are targeting with Model 3 and Model Y a global mass demographic with a broad range of potential customers, in which we have relatively limited experience projecting demand and pricing our products. We currently produce numerous international variants at a limited number of factories, and if our specific demand expectations for these variants prove inaccurate, we may not be able to timely generate deliveries matched to the vehicles that we produce in the same timeframe or that are commensurate with the size of our operations in a given region. Likewise, as we develop and grow our energy products and services worldwide, our success will depend on our ability to correctly forecast demand in various markets. Because we do not have independent dealer networks, we are responsible for delivering all of our vehicles to our customers. As our production volumes continue to grow, we have faced in the past, and may face challenges with deliveries at increasing volumes, particularly in international markets requiring significant transit times. We have also deployed a number of delivery models, such as deliveries to customers’ homes and workplaces and touchless deliveries, but there is no guarantee that such models will be scalable or be accepted globally. Likewise, as we ramp our energy products, we are working to substantially increase our production and installation capabilities. If we experience production delays or inaccurately forecast demand, our business, financial condition and operating results may be harmed. Moreover, because of our unique expertise with our vehicles, we recommend that our vehicles be serviced by us or by certain authorized professionals. If we experience delays in adding servicing capacity or servicing our vehicles efficiently, or experience unforeseen issues with the reliability of our vehicles, particularly higher-volume additions to our fleet such as Model 3 and Model Y, it could overburden our servicing capabilities and parts inventory. Similarly, the increasing number of Tesla vehicles also requires us to continue to rapidly increase the number of our Supercharger stations and connectors throughout the world. There is no assurance that we will be able to ramp our business to meet our sales, delivery, installation, servicing and vehicle charging targets globally, that our projections on which such targets are based will prove accurate or that the pace of growth or coverage of our customer infrastructure network will meet customer expectations. These plans require significant cash investments and management resources and there is no guarantee that they will generate additional sales or installations of our products, or that we will be able to avoid cost overruns or be able to hire additional personnel to support them. As we expand, we will also need to ensure our compliance with regulatory requirements in various jurisdictions applicable to the sale, installation and servicing of our products, the sale or dispatch of electricity related to our energy products and the operation of Superchargers. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, it may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. We will need to maintain and significantly grow our access to battery cells, including through the development and manufacture of our own cells, and control our related costs. We are dependent on the continued supply of lithium-ion battery cells for our vehicles and energy storage products, and we will require substantially more cells to grow our business according to our plans. Currently, we rely on suppliers such as Panasonic and Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL) for these cells. We have to date fully qualified only a very limited number of such suppliers and have limited flexibility in changing suppliers. Any disruption in the supply of battery cells from our suppliers could limit production of our vehicles and energy storage products. In the long term, we intend to supplement cells from our suppliers with cells manufactured by us, which we believe will be more efficient, manufacturable at greater volumes and more cost-effective 16 than currently available cells. However, our efforts to develop and manufacture such battery cells have required, and may continue to require, significant investments, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these targets in the timeframes that we have planned or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail our planned vehicle and energy storage product production or procure additional cells from suppliers at potentially greater costs, either of which may harm our business and operating results. In addition, the cost and mass production of battery cells, whether manufactured by our suppliers or by us, depends in part upon the prices and availability of raw materials such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and/or other metals. The prices for these materials fluctuate and their available supply may be unstable, depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials. For example, as a result of increased global production of electric vehicles and energy storage products, suppliers of these raw materials may be unable to meet our volume needs. Additionally, our suppliers may not be willing or able to reliably meet our timelines or our cost and quality needs, which may require us to replace them with other sources. Any reduced availability of these materials may impact our access to cells and our growth, and any increases in their prices may reduce our profitability if we cannot recoup such costs through increased prices. Moreover, our inability to meet demand and any product price increases may harm our brand, growth, prospects and operating results. Our future growth and success are dependent upon consumers’ demand for electric vehicles and specifically our vehicles in an automotive industry that is generally competitive, cyclical and volatile. Though we continue to see increased interest and adoption of electric vehicles, if the market for electric vehicles in general and Tesla vehicles in particular does not develop as we expect, develops more slowly than we expect, or if demand for our vehicles decreases in our markets or our vehicles compete with each other, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results may be harmed. In addition, electric vehicles still constitute a small percentage of overall vehicle sales. As a result, the market for our vehicles could be negatively affected by numerous factors, such as: • perceptions about electric vehicle features, quality, safety, performance and cost; • perceptions about the limited range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge, and access to charging facilities; • competition, including from other types of alternative fuel vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and high fuel-economy internal combustion engine vehicles; • volatility in the cost of oil, gasoline and energy, such as wide fluctuations in crude oil prices during 2020; • government regulations and economic incentives and conditions; and • concerns about our future viability. Finally, the target demographics for our vehicles, particularly Model 3 and Model Y, are highly competitive. Sales of vehicles in the automotive industry tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to further volatility. We face strong competition for our products and services from a growing list of established and new competitors. The worldwide automotive market is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future. For example, Model 3 and Model Y face competition from existing and future automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive entry-level premium sedan and compact SUV markets. A significant and growing number of established and new automobile manufacturers, as well as other companies, have entered, or are reported to have plans to enter, the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles, as well as the market for self-driving technology and other vehicle applications and software platforms. In some cases, our competitors offer or will offer electric vehicles in important markets such as China and Europe, and/or have announced an intention to produce electric vehicles exclusively at some point in the future. Many of our competitors have significantly more or better-established resources than we do to devote to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products. Increased competition could result in our lower vehicle unit sales, price reductions, revenue shortfalls, loss of customers and loss of market share, which may harm our business, financial condition and operating results. We also face competition in our energy generation and storage business from other manufacturers, developers, installers and service providers of competing energy technologies, as well as from large utilities. Decreases in the retail or wholesale prices of electricity from utilities or other renewable energy sources could make our products less attractive to customers and lead to an increased rate of customer defaults. 17 Risks Related to Our Operations We may experience issues with lithium-ion cells or other components manufactured at our Gigafactories, which may harm the production and profitability of our vehicle and energy storage products. Our plan to grow the volume and profitability of our vehicles and energy storage products depends on significant lithium-ion battery cell production, including by our partner Panasonic at Gigafactory Nevada. We also produce several vehicle components at our Gigafactories, such as battery modules and packs and drive units, and manufacture energy storage products. In the past, some of the manufacturing lines for certain product components took longer than anticipated to ramp to their full capacity, and additional bottlenecks may arise in the future as we continue to increase the production rate and introduce new lines. In addition, as the IRA provides new incentives for domestic energy production and manufacturing, we may face increasing competition from other automobile manufacturers as well as suppliers for the resources and capacity to build additional factories and expand our operations domestically. If we are unable to or otherwise do not maintain and grow our respective operations, or if we are unable to do so cost-effectively or hire and retain highly-skilled personnel there, our ability to manufacture our products profitably would be limited, which may harm our business and operating results. Finally, the high volumes of lithium-ion cells and battery modules and packs manufactured by us and by our suppliers are stored and recycled at our various facilities. Any mishandling of these products may cause disruption to the operation of such facilities. While we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells, there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations. Any such disruptions or issues may harm our brand and business. We face risks associated with maintaining and expanding our international operations, including unfavorable and uncertain regulatory, political, economic, tax and labor conditions. We are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, political uncertainty and social, environmental and economic conditions in numerous jurisdictions, including markets in which we generate significant sales, over which we have little control and which are inherently unpredictable. Our operations in such jurisdictions, particularly as a company based in the U.S., create risks relating to conforming our products to regulatory and safety requirements and charging and other electric infrastructures; organizing local operating entities; establishing, staffing and managing foreign business locations; attracting local customers; navigating foreign government taxes, regulations and permit requirements; enforceability of our contractual rights; trade restrictions, customs regulations, tariffs and price or exchange controls; and preferences in foreign nations for domestically manufactured products. Such conditions may increase our costs, impact our ability to sell our products and require significant management attention, and may harm our business if we are unable to manage them effectively. Our business may suffer if our products or features contain defects, fail to perform as expected or take longer than expected to become fully functional. If our products contain design or manufacturing defects that cause them not to perform as expected or that require repair, or certain features of our vehicles such as new Autopilot or FSD features take longer than expected to become enabled, are legally restricted or become subject to onerous regulation, our ability to develop, market and sell our products and services may be harmed, and we may experience delivery delays, product recalls, product liability, breach of warranty and consumer protection claims and significant warranty and other expenses. There is no guarantee that any incremental changes in the specific equipment we deploy in our vehicles over time will not result in initial functional disparities from prior iterations or will perform as expected in the timeframe we anticipate, or at all. Our products are also highly dependent on software, which is inherently complex and may contain latent defects or errors or be subject to external attacks. Issues experienced by our customers have included those related to taillights, seat belt chimes and display screens in certain Tesla models. Although we attempt to remedy any issues we observe in our products as effectively and rapidly as possible, such efforts may not be timely, may hamper production or may not completely satisfy our customers. While we have performed, and continue to perform, extensive internal testing on our products and features, we currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate their long-term quality, reliability, durability and performance characteristics. There can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defects in our products prior to their sale to or installation for customers. We may be required to defend or insure against product liability claims. The automobile industry generally experiences significant product liability claims, and as such we face the risk of such claims in the event our vehicles do not perform or are claimed to not have performed as expected. As is true for other automakers, our vehicles have been involved and we expect in the future will be involved in accidents resulting in death or personal injury, and such accidents where Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot or FSD Capability features are engaged are the subject of significant public attention, especially in light of NHTSA’s Standing General Order requiring reports regarding crashes involving vehicles with advanced driver assistance systems. We have experienced, and we expect to continue to face, claims and regulatory scrutiny arising from or related to misuse or claimed failures or alleged misrepresentations of such new technologies that we are pioneering. In addition, the battery packs that we produce make use of lithium-ion cells. On rare occasions, lithium-ion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting 18 smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithium-ion cells. While we have designed our battery packs to passively contain any single cell’s release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells, there can be no assurance that a field or testing failure of our vehicles or other battery packs that we produce will not occur, in particular due to a high-speed crash. Likewise, as our solar energy systems and energy storage products generate and store electricity, they have the potential to fail or cause injury to people or property. Any product liability claim may subject us to lawsuits and substantial monetary damages, product recalls or redesign efforts, and even a meritless claim may require us to defend it, all of which may generate negative publicity and be expensive and time-consuming. In most jurisdictions, we generally self-insure against the risk of product liability claims for vehicle exposure, meaning that any product liability claims will likely have to be paid from company funds and not by insurance. We will need to maintain public credibility and confidence in our long-term business prospects in order to succeed. In order to maintain and grow our business, we must maintain credibility and confidence among customers, suppliers, analysts, investors, ratings agencies and other parties in our long-term financial viability and business prospects. Maintaining such confidence may be challenging due to our limited operating history relative to established competitors; customer unfamiliarity with our products; any delays we may experience in scaling manufacturing, delivery and service operations to meet demand; competition and uncertainty regarding the future of electric vehicles or our other products and services; our quarterly production and sales performance compared with market expectations; and other factors including those over which we have no control. In particular, Tesla’s products, business, results of operations, and statements and actions of Tesla and its management are well-publicized by a range of third parties. Such attention can include criticism, which may be exaggerated or unfounded, such as speculation regarding the sufficiency or stability of our management team. Any such negative perceptions, whether caused by us or not, may harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional funds if needed. We may be unable to effectively grow, or manage the compliance, residual value, financing and credit risks related to, our various financing programs. We offer financing arrangements for our vehicles in North America, Europe and Asia primarily ourselves and through various financial institutions. We also currently offer vehicle financing arrangements directly through our local subsidiaries in certain markets. Depending on the country, such arrangements are available for specified models and may include operating leases directly with us under which we typically receive only a very small portion of the total vehicle purchase price at the time of lease, followed by a stream of payments over the term of the lease. We have also offered various arrangements for customers of our solar energy systems whereby they pay us a fixed payment to lease or finance the purchase of such systems or purchase electricity generated by them. If we do not successfully monitor and comply with applicable national, state and/or local financial regulations and consumer protection laws governing these transactions, we may become subject to enforcement actions or penalties. The profitability of any directly-leased vehicles returned to us at the end of their leases depends on our ability to accurately project our vehicles’ residual values at the outset of the leases, and such values may fluctuate prior to the end of their terms depending on various factors such as supply and demand of our used vehicles, economic cycles and the pricing of new vehicles. We have made in the past and may make in the future certain adjustments to our prices from time to time in the ordinary course of business, which may impact the residual values of our vehicles and reduce the profitability of our vehicle leasing program. The funding and growth of this program also rely on our ability to secure adequate financing and/or business partners. If we are unable to adequately fund our leasing program through internal funds, partners or other financing sources, and compelling alternative financing programs are not available for our customers who may expect or need such options, we may be unable to grow our vehicle deliveries. Furthermore, if our vehicle leasing business grows substantially, our business may suffer if we cannot effectively manage the resulting greater levels of residual risk. Similarly, we have provided resale value guarantees to vehicle customers and partners for certain financing programs, under which such counterparties may sell their vehicles back to us at certain points in time at pre-determined amounts. However, actual resale values are subject to fluctuations over the term of the financing arrangements, such as from the vehicle pricing changes discussed above. If the actual resale values of any vehicles resold or returned to us pursuant to these programs are materially lower than the pre-determined amounts we have offered, our financial condition and operating results may be harmed. Finally, our vehicle and solar energy system financing programs and our energy storage sales programs also expose us to customer credit risk. In the event of a widespread economic downturn or other catastrophic event, our customers may be unable or unwilling to satisfy their payment obligations to us on a timely basis or at all. If a significant number of our customers default, we may incur substantial credit losses and/or impairment charges with respect to the underlying assets. 19 We must manage ongoing obligations under our agreement with the Research Foundation for the State University of New York relating to our Gigafactory New York. We are party to an operating lease and a research and development agreement through the State University of New York (the “SUNY Foundation”). These agreements provide for the construction and use of our Gigafactory New York, which we have primarily used for the development and production of our Solar Roof and other solar products and components, energy storage components and Supercharger components, and for other lessor-approved functions. Under this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during a period that was initially 10 years beginning April 30, 2018. As of December 31, 2022, we are currently in excess of such targets relating to investments and personnel in the State of New York and Buffalo. While we expect to have and grow significant operations at Gigafactory New York and the surrounding Buffalo area, any failure by us in any year over the course of the term of the agreement to meet all applicable future obligations may result in our obligation to pay a “program payment” of $41 million to the SUNY Foundation for such year, the termination of our lease at Gigafactory New York which may require us to pay additional penalties, and/or the need to adjust certain of our operations, in particular our production ramp of the Solar Roof or other components. Any of the foregoing events may harm our business, financial condition and operating results. If we are unable to attract, hire and retain key employees and qualified personnel, our ability to compete may be harmed. The loss of the services of any of our key employees or any significant portion of our workforce could disrupt our operations or delay the development, introduction and ramp of our products and services. In particular, we are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer. None of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term and we may not be able to successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business. Our future success also depends upon our ability to attract, hire and retain a large number of engineering, manufacturing, marketing, sales and delivery, service, installation, technology and support personnel, especially to support our planned high-volume product sales, market and geographical expansion and technological innovations. If we are not successful in managing these risks, our business, financial condition and operating results may be harmed. Employees may leave Tesla or choose other employers over Tesla due to various factors, such as a very competitive labor market for talented individuals with automotive or technology experience, or any negative publicity related to us. In regions where we have or will have operations, particularly significant engineering and manufacturing centers, there is strong competition for individuals with skillsets needed for our business, including specialized knowledge of electric vehicles, engineering and electrical and building construction expertise. Moreover, we may be impacted by perceptions relating to reductions in force that we have conducted in the past in order to optimize our organizational structure and reduce costs and the departure of certain senior personnel for various reasons. We also compete with both mature and prosperous companies that have far greater financial resources than we do and start-ups and emerging companies that promise short-term growth opportunities. Finally, our compensation philosophy for all of our personnel reflects our startup origins, with an emphasis on equity-based awards and benefits in order to closely align their incentives with the long-term interests of our stockholders. We periodically seek and obtain approval from our stockholders for future increases to the number of awards available under our equity incentive and employee stock purchase plans. If we are unable to obtain the requisite stockholder approvals for such future increases, we may have to expend additional cash to compensate our employees and our ability to retain and hire qualified personnel may be harmed. We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer. We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer. Although Mr. Musk spends significant time with Tesla and is highly active in our management, he does not devote his full time and attention to Tesla. Mr. Musk also currently serves as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technical Officer of Space Exploration Technologies Corp., a developer and manufacturer of space launch vehicles, Chief Executive Officer of Twitter, Inc., a social media company, and is involved in other emerging technology ventures. 20 Our information technology systems or data, or those of our service providers or customers or users could be subject to cyber-attacks or other security incidents, which could result in data breaches, intellectual property theft, claims, litigation, regulatory investigations, significant liability, reputational damage and other adverse consequences. We continue to expand our information technology systems as our operations grow, such as product data management, procurement, inventory management, production planning and execution, sales, service and logistics, dealer management, financial, tax and regulatory compliance systems. This includes the implementation of new internally developed systems and the deployment of such systems in the U.S. and abroad. While, we maintain information technology measures designed to protect us against intellectual property theft, data breaches, sabotage and other external or internal cyber-attacks or misappropriation, our systems and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to malware, ransomware, viruses, denial-of-service attacks, phishing attacks, social engineering, computer hacking, unauthorized access, exploitation of bugs, defects and vulnerabilities, breakdowns, damage, interruptions, system malfunctions, power outages, terrorism, acts of vandalism, security breaches, security incidents, inadvertent or intentional actions by employees or other third parties, and other cyber-attacks. To the extent any security incident results in unauthorized access or damage to or acquisition, use, corruption, loss, destruction, alteration or dissemination of our data, including intellectual property and personal information, or our products or vehicles, or for it to be believed or reported that any of these occurred, it could disrupt our business, harm our reputation, compel us to comply with applicable data breach notification laws, subject us to time consuming, distracting and expensive litigation, regulatory investigation and oversight, mandatory corrective action, require us to verify the correctness of database contents, or otherwise subject us to liability under laws, regulations and contractual obligations, including those that protect the privacy and security of personal information. This could result in increased costs to us and result in significant legal and financial exposure and/or reputational harm. We also rely on service providers, and similar incidents relating to their information technology systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business. There have been and may continue to be significant supply chain attacks. Our service providers, including our workforce management software provider, have been subject to ransomware and other security incidents, and we cannot guarantee that our or our service providers’ systems have not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects, bugs, or vulnerabilities that could result in a security incident, or other disruption to, our or our service providers’ systems. Our ability to monitor our service providers’ security measures is limited, and, in any event, malicious third parties may be able to circumvent those security measures. Further, the implementation, maintenance, segregation and improvement of these systems require significant management time, support and cost, and there are inherent risks associated with developing, improving and expanding our core systems as well as implementing new systems and updating current systems, including disruptions to the related areas of business operation. These risks may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory, procure parts or supplies or manufacture, sell, deliver and service products, adequately protect our intellectual property or achieve and maintain compliance with, or realize available benefits under, tax laws and other applicable regulations. Moreover, if we do not successfully implement, maintain or expand these systems as planned, our operations may be disrupted, our ability to accurately and/or timely report our financial results could be impaired and deficiencies may arise in our internal control over financial reporting, which may impact our ability to certify our financial results. Moreover, our proprietary information, including intellectual property and personal information, could be compromised or misappropriated and our reputation may be adversely affected. If these systems or their functionality do not operate as we expect them to, we may be required to expend significant resources to make corrections or find alternative sources for performing these functions. Any unauthorized control or manipulation of our products’ systems could result in loss of confidence in us and our products. Our products contain complex information technology systems. For example, our vehicles and energy storage products are designed with built-in data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates from us to improve or update their functionality. While we have implemented security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology networks, our products and their systems, malicious entities have reportedly attempted, and may attempt in the future, to gain unauthorized access to modify, alter and use such networks, products and systems to gain control of, or to change, our products’ functionality, user interface and performance characteristics or to gain access to data stored in or generated by our products. We encourage reporting of potential vulnerabilities in the security of our products through our security vulnerability reporting policy, and we aim to remedy any reported and verified vulnerability. However, there can be no assurance that any vulnerabilities will not be exploited before they can be identified, or that our remediation efforts are or will be successful. Any unauthorized access to or control of our products or their systems or any loss of data could result in legal claims or government investigations. In addition, regardless of their veracity, reports of unauthorized access to our products, their systems or data, as well as other factors that may result in the perception that our products, their systems or data are capable of being hacked, may harm our brand, prospects and operating results. We have been the subject of such reports in the past. 21 Our business may be adversely affected by any disruptions caused by union activities. It is not uncommon for employees of certain trades at companies such as ours to belong to a union, which can result in higher employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages. Moreover, regulations in some jurisdictions outside of the U.S. mandate employee participation in industrial collective bargaining agreements and work councils with certain consultation rights with respect to the relevant companies’ operations. Although we work diligently to provide the best possible work environment for our employees, they may still decide to join or seek recognition to form a labor union, or we may be required to become a union signatory. From time to time, labor unions have engaged in campaigns to organize certain of our operations, as part of which such unions have filed unfair labor practice charges against us with the National Labor Relations Board (the “NLRB”), and they may do so in the future. In September 2019, an administrative law judge issued a recommended decision for Tesla on certain issues and against us on certain others. In March 2021, the NLRB adopted a portion of the recommendation and overturned others. Tesla appealed the decision to the United States Circuit Court for the Fifth Circuit, which is currently pending. Any unfavorable ultimate outcome for Tesla may have a negative impact on the perception of Tesla’s treatment of our employees. Furthermore, we are directly or indirectly dependent upon companies with unionized work forces, such as suppliers and trucking and freight companies. Any work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could delay the manufacture and sale of our products and may harm our business and operating results. We may choose to or be compelled to undertake product recalls or take other similar actions. As a manufacturing company, we must manage the risk of product recalls with respect to our products. Recalls for our vehicles have resulted from various hardware and software-related safety defect or non-compliance determinations. In addition to recalls initiated by us for various causes, testing of or investigations into our products by government regulators or industry groups may compel us to initiate product recalls or may result in negative public perceptions about the safety of our products, even if we disagree with the defect determination or have data that contradicts it. In the future, we may voluntarily or involuntarily initiate recalls if any of our products are determined by us or a regulator to contain a safety defect or be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations, such as U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. Such recalls, whether voluntary or involuntary or caused by systems or components engineered or manufactured by us or our suppliers, could result in significant expense, supply chain complications and service burdens, and may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Our current and future warranty reserves may be insufficient to cover future warranty claims. We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles we sell. We also provide certain warranties with respect to the energy generation and storage systems we sell, including on their installation and maintenance. For components not manufactured by us, we generally pass through to our customers the applicable manufacturers’ warranties, but may retain some warranty responsibilities for some or all of the life of such components. As part of our energy generation and storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that guarantee that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or other energy performance requirements specified in the contract. Under these performance guarantees, we generally bear the risk of electricity production or other performance shortfalls, including in some cases shortfalls caused by failures in components from third party manufacturers. These risks are exacerbated in the event such manufacturers cease operations or fail to honor their warranties. If our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our products, our financial condition and operating results may be harmed. Warranty reserves include our management’s best estimates of the projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty, which are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. Such estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected experience, especially with respect to products that we have introduced relatively recently and/or that we expect to produce at significantly greater volumes than our past products, may cause material changes to our warranty reserves in the future. Our insurance coverage strategy may not be adequate to protect us from all business risks. We may be subject, in the ordinary course of business, to losses resulting from products liability, accidents, acts of God and other claims against us, for which we may have no insurance coverage. As a general matter, we do not maintain as much insurance coverage as many other companies do, and in some cases, we do not maintain any at all. Additionally, the policies that we do have may include significant deductibles or self-insured retentions, policy limitations and exclusions, and we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future losses or claims against us. A loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits may require us to pay substantial amounts, which may harm our financial condition and operating results. 22 Our debt agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business. The terms of certain of our debt facilities contain, and any of our other future debt agreements may contain, covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business, including restrictions on our and/or our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur additional debt or create liens. In addition, under certain circumstances we are required to comply with a fixed charge coverage ratio. As a result of these covenants, our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and engage in beneficial transactions, including to obtain additional financing as needed, may be restricted. Furthermore, our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a default under our debt agreements, which could permit the holders to accelerate our obligation to repay the debt. If any of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to repay it. Additional funds may not be available to us when we need or want them. Our business and our future plans for expansion are capital-intensive, and the specific timing of cash inflows and outflows may fluctuate substantially from period to period. We may need or want to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-related or debt securities or through obtaining credit from financial institutions to fund, together with our principal sources of liquidity, the costs of developing and manufacturing our current or future products, to pay any significant unplanned or accelerated expenses or for new significant strategic investments, or to refinance our significant consolidated indebtedness, even if not required to do so by the terms of such indebtedness. We cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. We may be negatively impacted by any early obsolescence of our manufacturing equipment. We depreciate the cost of our manufacturing equipment over their expected useful lives. However, product cycles or manufacturing technology may change periodically, and we may decide to update our products or manufacturing processes more quickly than expected. Moreover, improvements in engineering and manufacturing expertise and efficiency may result in our ability to manufacture our products using less of our currently installed equipment. Alternatively, as we ramp and mature the production of our products to higher levels, we may discontinue the use of already installed equipment in favor of different or additional equipment. The useful life of any equipment that would be retired early as a result would be shortened, causing the depreciation on such equipment to be accelerated, and our results of operations may be harmed. There is no guarantee that we will have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our indebtedness or that we will not incur additional indebtedness. As of December 31, 2022, we and our subsidiaries had outstanding $2.06 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness (see Note 11, Debt , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Our consolidated indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to any generally adverse economic and industry conditions. We and our subsidiaries may, subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing and future indebtedness, incur additional debt, secure existing or future debt or recapitalize our debt. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal and interest on our indebtedness when due, to make payments upon conversion or repurchase demands with respect to our convertible senior notes or to refinance our indebtedness as we may need or desire, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our existing indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur, and to make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. In addition, our ability to make payments may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. We may not be able to engage in these activities on desirable terms or at all, which may result in a default on our existing or future indebtedness and harm our financial condition and operating results. 23 We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We transact business globally in multiple currencies and have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, costs of revenue, operating expenses and localized subsidiary debt denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, currently primarily the Chinese yuan, euro, pound sterling and Norwegian krone. To the extent we have significant revenues denominated in such foreign currencies, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar would tend to reduce our revenues as measured in U.S. dollars, as we have historically experienced, and are currently experiencing. In addition, a portion of our costs and expenses have been, and we anticipate will continue to be, denominated in foreign currencies, including the Chinese yuan and Japanese yen. If we do not have fully offsetting revenues in these currencies and if the value of the U.S. dollar depreciates significantly against these currencies, our costs as measured in U.S. dollars as a percent of our revenues will correspondingly increase and our margins will suffer. Moreover, while we undertake limited hedging activities intended to offset the impact of currency translation exposure, it is impossible to predict or eliminate such impact. As a result, our operating results may be harmed. We may need to defend ourselves against intellectual property infringement claims, which may be time-consuming and expensive. Our competitors or other third parties may hold or obtain patents, copyrights, trademarks or other proprietary rights that could prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use, develop, sell or market our products and services, which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business. From time to time, the holders of such intellectual property rights may assert their rights and urge us to take licenses and/or may bring suits alleging infringement or misappropriation of such rights, which could result in substantial costs, negative publicity and management attention, regardless of merit. While we endeavor to obtain and protect the intellectual property rights that we expect will allow us to retain or advance our strategic initiatives, there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately identify and protect the portions of intellectual property that are strategic to our business, or mitigate the risk of potential suits or other legal demands by our competitors. Accordingly, we may consider the entering into licensing agreements with respect to such rights, although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur, and such licenses and associated litigation could significantly increase our operating expenses. In addition, if we are determined to have or believe there is a high likelihood that we have infringed upon a third party’s intellectual property rights, we may be required to cease making, selling or incorporating certain components or intellectual property into the goods and services we offer, to pay substantial damages and/or license royalties, to redesign our products and services and/or to establish and maintain alternative branding for our products and services. In the event that we are required to take one or more such actions, our brand, business, financial condition and operating results may be harmed. Increased scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders with respect to the Company’s ESG practices may result in additional costs or risks. Companies across many industries are facing increasing scrutiny related to their environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices. Investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds and other influential investors are also increasingly focused on ESG practices and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the non-financial impacts of their investments. While our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy, if our ESG practices do not meet investor or other industry stakeholder expectations, which continue to evolve, we may incur additional costs and our brand, ability to attract and retain qualified employees and business may be harmed. Our operations could be adversely affected by events outside of our control, such as natural disasters, wars or health epidemics. We may be impacted by natural disasters, wars, health epidemics, weather conditions, the long-term effects of climate change, power outages or other events outside of our control. For example, our Fremont Factory and Gigafactory Nevada are located in seismically active regions in Northern California and Nevada, and our Gigafactory Shanghai is located in a flood-prone area. Moreover, the area in which our Gigafactory Texas is located experienced severe winter storms in the first quarter of 2021 that had a widespread impact on utilities and transportation. If major disasters such as earthquakes, floods or other climate-related events occur, or our information system or communication breaks down or operates improperly, our headquarters and production facilities may be seriously damaged, or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our products. In addition, the global COVID-19 pandemic has impacted economic markets, manufacturing operations, supply chains, employment and consumer behavior in nearly every geographic region and industry across the world, and we have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected as a result. Also, the broader consequences in the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which may include further embargoes, regional instability and geopolitical shifts; airspace bans relating to certain routes, or strategic decisions to alter certain routes; and potential retaliatory action by the Russian government against companies, and the extent of the conflict on our business and operating results cannot be predicted. We may incur expenses or delays relating to such events outside of our control, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. 24 Risks Related to Government Laws and Regulations Demand for our products and services may be impacted by the status of government and economic incentives supporting the development and adoption of such products. Government and economic incentives that support the development and adoption of electric vehicles in the U.S. and abroad, including certain tax exemptions, tax credits and rebates, may be reduced, eliminated or exhausted from time to time. For example, previously available incentives favoring electric vehicles in areas including Ontario, Canada, Netherlands, Italy, Hong Kong and California have expired or were cancelled or temporarily unavailable, and in some cases were not eventually replaced or reinstituted, which may have negatively impacted sales. Certain government and economic incentives, similar to the IRA, may also be implemented that provide benefits to manufacturers who assemble domestically, have local suppliers or have other characteristics that may not apply to Tesla. Such developments could negatively impact demand for our vehicles, and we and our customers may have to adjust to them, including through pricing modifications. In addition, certain governmental rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives that are currently available with respect to our solar and energy storage product businesses allow us to lower our costs and encourage customers to buy our products and investors to invest in our solar financing funds. However, these incentives may expire when the allocated funding is exhausted, reduced or terminated as renewable energy adoption rates increase, sometimes without warning. Likewise, in jurisdictions where net metering is currently available, our customers receive bill credits from utilities for energy that their solar energy systems generate and export to the grid in excess of the electric load they use. The benefit available under net metering has been or has been proposed to be reduced, altered or eliminated in several jurisdictions, and has also been contested and may continue to be contested before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Any reductions or terminations of such incentives may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results by making our products less competitive for customers, increasing our cost of capital and adversely impacting our ability to attract investment partners and to form new financing funds for our solar and energy storage assets. Finally, we and our fund investors claim these U.S. federal tax credits and certain state incentives in amounts based on independently appraised fair market values of our solar and energy storage systems. Some governmental authorities have audited such values and in certain cases have determined that these values should be lower, and they may do so again in the future. Such determinations may result in adverse tax consequences and/or our obligation to make indemnification or other payments to our funds or fund investors. We are subject to evolving laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs, legal prohibitions or unfavorable changes upon our operations or products. As we grow our manufacturing operations in additional regions, we are or will be subject to complex environmental, manufacturing, health and safety laws and regulations at numerous jurisdictional levels in the U.S., China, Germany and other locations abroad, including laws relating to the use, handling, storage, recycling, disposal and/or human exposure to hazardous materials, product material inputs and post-consumer products and with respect to constructing, expanding and maintaining our facilities. New, or changes in, environmental and climate change laws, regulations or rules could also lead to increased costs of compliance, including remediations of any discovered issues, and changes to our operations, which may be significant, and any failures to comply could result in significant expenses, delays or fines. In addition, as we have increased our employee headcount and operations, we are and may continue to be subject to increased scrutiny, including litigation and government investigations relating to allegations such as discrimination and workplace misconduct, that we will need to defend against. If we are unable to successfully defend ourselves in such litigation or government investigations, it may harm our brand, ability to attract and retain qualified employees, business and financial condition. We are also subject to laws and regulations applicable to the supply, manufacture, import, sale, service and performance of our products both domestically and abroad. For example, in countries outside of the U.S., we are required to meet standards relating to vehicle safety, fuel economy and emissions that are often materially different from equivalent requirements in the U.S., thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicles and systems to ensure regulatory compliance in all countries. This process may include official review and certification of our vehicles by foreign regulatory agencies prior to market entry, as well as compliance with foreign reporting and recall management systems requirements. In particular, we offer in our vehicles in certain markets Autopilot and FSD Capability features that today assist drivers with certain tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel, but which currently require drivers to remain fully engaged in the driving operation. We are continuing to develop our Autopilot and FSD Capability technology. There are a variety of international, federal and state regulations that may apply to, and may adversely affect, the design and performance, sale, registration and operation of Autopilot and FSD Capability, and future capability, including full self-driving vehicles that may not be operated by a human driver. This includes many existing vehicle standards that were not originally intended to apply to vehicles that may not be operated by a human driver. Such regulations continue to rapidly change, which increases the likelihood of a patchwork of complex or conflicting regulations, or may delay, restrict or prohibit the availability of certain functionalities and vehicle designs, which could adversely affect our business. Finally, as a manufacturer, installer and service provider with respect to solar generation and energy storage systems, a supplier of electricity generated and stored by certain of the solar energy and energy storage systems we install for customers, and a provider of 25 grid services through virtual power plant models, we are impacted by federal, state and local regulations and policies concerning the import or export of components, electricity pricing, the interconnection of electricity generation and storage equipment with the electrical grid and the sale of electricity generated by third party-owned systems. If regulations and policies are introduced that adversely impact the import or export of components, or the interconnection, maintenance or use of our solar and energy storage systems, they could deter potential customers from purchasing our solar and energy storage products and services, threaten the economics of our existing contracts and cause us to cease solar and energy storage system sales and services in the relevant jurisdictions, which may harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Any failure by us to comply with a variety of U.S. and international privacy and consumer protection laws may harm us. Any failure by us or our vendor or other business partners to comply with our public privacy notice or with federal, state or international privacy, data protection or security laws or regulations relating to the processing, collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable information could result in regulatory or litigation-related actions against us, legal liability, fines, damages, ongoing audit requirements and other significant costs. Substantial expenses and operational changes may be required in connection with maintaining compliance with such laws, and even an unsuccessful challenge by customers or regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from and defense by us. In addition, certain emerging privacy laws are still subject to a high degree of uncertainty as to their interpretation, application and impact, and may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs, adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or services we offer, or result in adverse publicity and harm our reputation. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation applies to the processing of personal information collected from individuals located in the European Union, and has created new compliance obligations and significantly increased fines for noncompliance. Similarly, the California Consumer Privacy Act imposes certain legal obligations on our use and processing of personal information related to California residents. Finally, new privacy and cybersecurity laws have come into effect in China. In addition to the risks related to general privacy regulation, we may also be subject to specific vehicle manufacturer obligations relating to cybersecurity, data privacy and data localization requirements which place additional risks to our international operations. Risks and penalties could include ongoing audit requirements, data protection authority investigations, legal proceedings by international governmental entities or others resulting in mandated disclosure of sensitive data or other commercially unfavorable terms. Notwithstanding our efforts to protect the security and integrity of our customers’ personal information, we may be required to expend significant resources to comply with data breach requirements if, for example, third parties improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customers or we otherwise experience a data loss with respect to customers’ personal information. A major breach of our network security and systems may result in fines, penalties and damages and harm our brand, prospects and operating results. We could be subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences arising out of certain governmental investigations and proceedings. We are cooperating with certain government investigations as discussed in Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. To our knowledge, no government agency in any such ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. However, we cannot predict the outcome or impact of any such ongoing matters, and there exists the possibility that we could be subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences if the SEC, the U.S. Department of Justice or any other government agency were to pursue legal action in the future. Moreover, we expect to incur costs in responding to related requests for information and subpoenas, and if instituted, in defending against any governmental proceedings. For example, on October 16, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment approving the terms of a settlement filed with the Court on September 29, 2018, in connection with the actions taken by the SEC relating to Mr. Musk’s statement on August 7, 2018 that he was considering taking Tesla private. Pursuant to the settlement, we, among other things, paid a civil penalty of $20 million, appointed an independent director as the chair of our board of directors, appointed two additional independent directors to our board of directors and made further enhancements to our disclosure controls and other corporate governance-related matters. On April 26, 2019, this settlement was amended to clarify certain of the previously-agreed disclosure procedures, which was subsequently approved by the Court. All other terms of the prior settlement were reaffirmed without modification. Although we intend to continue to comply with the terms and requirements of the settlement, if there is a lack of compliance or an alleged lack of compliance, additional enforcement actions or other legal proceedings may be instituted against us. 26 We may face regulatory challenges to or limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly. While we intend to continue to leverage our most effective sales strategies, including sales through our website, we may not be able to sell our vehicles through our own stores in certain states in the U.S. with laws that may be interpreted to impose limitations on this direct-to-consumer sales model. It has also been asserted that the laws in some states limit our ability to obtain dealer licenses from state motor vehicle regulators, and such assertions persist. In certain locations, decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles have been, and may be, challenged by dealer associations and others as to whether such decisions comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws. We have prevailed in many of these lawsuits and such results have reinforced our continuing belief that state franchise laws were not intended to apply to a manufacturer that does not have franchise dealers anywhere in the world. In some states, there have also been regulatory and legislative efforts by dealer associations to propose laws that, if enacted, would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales model. A few states have passed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate, but at the same time limits the number of dealer licenses we can obtain or stores that we can operate. The application of state laws applicable to our operations continues to be difficult to predict. Internationally, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our sales or other business practices. Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this area can be complex, difficult to interpret and may change over time. Continued regulatory limitations and other obstacles interfering with our ability to sell vehicles directly to consumers may harm our financial condition and operating results. Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock The trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile. The trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our common stock has experienced over the last 52 weeks an intra-day trading high of $384.29 per share and a low of $101.81 per share, as adjusted to give effect to the three-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend in August 2022 (the “2022 Stock Split”). The stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In particular, a large proportion of our common stock has been historically and may in the future be traded by short sellers which may put pressure on the supply and demand for our common stock, further influencing volatility in its market price. Public perception of our company or management and other factors outside of our control may additionally impact the stock price of companies like us that garner a disproportionate degree of public attention, regardless of actual operating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market or the market price of our shares, securities class action litigation has been filed against us. While we defend such actions vigorously, any judgment against us or any future stockholder litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources. Our financial results may vary significantly from period to period due to fluctuations in our operating costs and other factors. We expect our period-to-period financial results to vary based on our operating costs, which we anticipate will fluctuate as the pace at which we continue to design, develop and manufacture new products and increase production capacity by expanding our current manufacturing facilities and adding future facilities, may not be consistent or linear between periods. Additionally, our revenues from period to period may fluctuate as we introduce existing products to new markets for the first time and as we develop and introduce new products. As a result of these factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our financial results, especially in the short term, are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance. Moreover, our financial results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts, ratings agencies or investors, who may be focused only on short-term quarterly financial results. If any of this occurs, the trading price of our stock could fall substantially, either suddenly or over time. We may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business, which could cause our stock price to decline. We may provide from time to time guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance. Correctly identifying key factors affecting business conditions and predicting future events is inherently an uncertain process, and our guidance may not ultimately be accurate and has in the past been inaccurate in certain respects, such as the timing of new product manufacturing ramps. Our guidance is based on certain assumptions such as those relating to anticipated production and sales volumes (which generally are not linear throughout a given period), average sales prices, supplier and commodity costs and planned cost reductions. If our guidance varies from actual results, such as due to our assumptions not being met or the impact on our financial performance that could occur as a result of various risks and uncertainties, the market value of our common stock could decline significantly. 27 If Elon Musk were forced to sell shares of our common stock, either that he has pledged to secure certain personal loan obligations, or in satisfaction of other obligations, such sales could cause our stock price to decline. Certain banking institutions have made extensions of credit to Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, a portion of which was used to purchase shares of common stock in certain of our public offerings and private placements at the same prices offered to third-party participants in such offerings and placements. We are not a party to these loans, which are partially secured by pledges of a portion of the Tesla common stock currently owned by Mr. Musk. If the price of our common stock were to decline substantially, Mr. Musk may be forced by one or more of the banking institutions to sell shares of Tesla common stock to satisfy his loan obligations if he could not do so through other means. Any such sales could cause the price of our common stock to decline further. Further, Mr. Musk from time to time may commit to investing in significant business or other ventures, and as a result, be required to sell shares of our common stock in satisfaction of such commitments. Anti-takeover provisions contained in our governing documents, applicable laws and our convertible senior notes could impair a takeover attempt. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws afford certain rights and powers to our board of directors that may facilitate the delay or prevention of an acquisition that it deems undesirable. We are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and other provisions of Delaware law that limit the ability of stockholders in certain situations to effect certain business combinations. In addition, the terms of our convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase such notes in the event of a fundamental change, including a takeover of our company. Any of the foregoing provisions and terms that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock. 28 ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES We are headquartered in Austin, Texas. Our principal facilities include a large number of properties in North America, Europe and Asia utilized for manufacturing and assembly, warehousing, engineering, retail and service locations, Supercharger sites and administrative and sales offices. Our facilities are used to support both of our reporting segments, and are suitable and adequate for the conduct of our business. We primarily lease such facilities with the exception of some manufacturing facilities. The following table sets forth the location of our primary owned and leased manufacturing facilities. Primary Manufacturing Facilities Location Owned or Leased Gigafactory Texas Austin, Texas Owned Fremont Factory Fremont, California Owned Gigafactory Nevada Sparks, Nevada Owned Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg Grunheide, Germany Owned Gigafactory Shanghai Shanghai, China * Gigafactory New York Buffalo, New York Leased Megafactory Lathrop, California Leased * We own the building and the land use rights with an initial term of 50 years. The land use rights are treated as operating lease right-of-use assets. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS For a description of our material pending legal proceedings, please see Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, each of the matters below is being disclosed pursuant to Item 103 of Regulation S-K because it relates to environmental regulations and aggregate civil penalties that we currently believe could potentially exceed $1 million. We believe that any proceeding that is material to our business or financial condition is likely to have potential penalties far in excess of such amount. The German Umweltbundesamt issued our subsidiary in Germany a notice and fine in the amount of 12 million euro alleging its non-compliance under applicable laws relating to market participation notifications and take-back obligations with respect to end-of-life battery products required thereunder. In response to Tesla’s objection, the German Umweltbundesamt issued Tesla a revised fine notice dated April 29, 2021 in which it reduced the original fine amount to 1.45 million euro. This is primarily relating to administrative requirements, but Tesla has continued to take back battery packs, and filed a new objection in June 2021. A hearing took place on November 24, 2022, and the parties reached a settlement which resulted in a further reduction of the fine to 600,000 euro. Both parties have waived their right to appeal. District attorneys in certain California counties are conducting an investigation into Tesla’s waste segregation practices pursuant to Cal. Health & Saf. Code section 25100 et seq. and Cal. Civil Code § 1798.80. Tesla has implemented various remedial measures, including conducting training and audits, and enhancements to its site waste management programs. While the outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time, it is not currently expected to have a material adverse impact on our business. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable. 29 PART II ITEM 5.

ITEM 6. [ RESERVED] 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For further discussion of our products and services, technology and competitive strengths, refer to Item 1- Business. For discussion related to changes in financial condition and the results of operations for fiscal year 2021-related items, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2021, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 7, 2022. Overview and 2022 Highlights Our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. We design, develop, manufacture, lease and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles, solar energy generation systems and energy storage products. We also offer maintenance, installation, operation, financial and other services related to our products. Additionally, we are increasingly focused on products and services based on artificial intelligence, robotics and automation. In 2022, we produced 1,369,611 consumer vehicles and delivered 1,313,851 consumer vehicles, despite ongoing supply chain and logistics challenges and factory shutdowns. We are currently focused on increasing vehicle production, capacity and delivery capabilities, improving and developing battery technologies, improving our FSD capabilities, increasing the affordability and efficiency of our vehicles, bringing new products to market and expanding our global infrastructure. In 2022, we deployed 6.5 GWh of energy storage products and 348 megawatts of solar energy systems. We are currently focused on ramping production of energy storage products, improving our Solar Roof installation capability and efficiency, and increasing market share of retrofit and new build solar energy systems. In 2022, we recognized total revenues of $81.46 billion, respectively, representing an increase of $27.64 billion, compared to the prior year. We continue to ramp production, build new manufacturing capacity and expand our operations to enable increased deliveries and deployments of our products and further revenue growth. In 2022, our net income attributable to common stockholders was $12.56 billion, representing a favorable change of $7.04 billion, compared to the prior year. We continue to focus on improving our profitability through production and operational efficiencies. We ended 2022 with $22.19 billion in cash and cash equivalents and investments, representing an increase of $4.48 billion from the end of 2021. Our cash flows provided by operating activities during 2022 and 2021 were $14.72 billion and $11.50 billion, respectively, representing an increase of $3.23 billion. Capital expenditures amounted to $7.16 billion during 2022, compared to $6.48 billion during 2021. Sustained growth has allowed our business to generally fund itself, and we will continue investing in a number of capital-intensive projects in upcoming periods. Management Opportunities, Challenges and Uncertainties and 2023 Outlook Automotive—Production The following is a summary of the status of production of each of our announced vehicle models in production and under development, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K: Production Location Vehicle Model(s) Production Status Fremont Factory Model S / Model X Active Model 3 / Model Y Active Gigafactory Shanghai Model 3 / Model Y Active Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg Model Y Active Gigafactory Texas Model Y Active Cybertruck Tooling Gigafactory Nevada Tesla Semi Pilot production TBD Tesla Roadster In development TBD Robotaxi & Others In development 32 We are focused on growing our manufacturing capacity, which includes ramping all of our production vehicles to their installed production capacities as well as increasing production rate, efficiency and capacity at our current factories. The next phase of production growth will depend on the ramp at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas, as well as our ability to add to our available sources of battery cell supply by manufacturing our own cells that we are developing to have high-volume output, lower capital and production costs and longer range. Our goals are to improve vehicle performance, decrease production costs and increase affordability. However, these plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations, which may be exacerbated by the new product and manufacturing technologies we are introducing, the number of concurrent international projects, any industry-wide component constraints, labor shortages and any future impact from events outside of our control such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, we have set ambitious technological targets with our plans for battery cells as well as for iterative manufacturing and design improvements for our vehicles with each new factory. Automotive—Demand and Sales Our cost reduction efforts, cost innovation strategies, and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our vehicles’ affordability, and for example, have allowed us to competitively price our vehicles in China. We will also continue to generate demand and brand awareness by improving our vehicles’ performance and functionality, including through products based on artificial intelligence such as Autopilot and FSD, and other software features, and delivering new vehicles, such as the Tesla Semi in December 2022. Moreover, we expect to continue to benefit from ongoing electrification of the automotive sector and increasing environmental awareness. However, we operate in a cyclical industry that is sensitive to political and regulatory uncertainty, including with respect to trade and the environment, all of which can be compounded by inflationary pressures, rising energy prices, increases in interest rates and any future global impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, in the earlier part of 2022, the automotive industry in general experienced part shortages and supplier disruptions which impacted production leading to a general increase in vehicle pricing. As the year progressed, inflationary pressures increased across the markets in which we operate. In an effort to curb this trend, central banks in developed countries raised interest rates rapidly and substantially, impacting the affordability of vehicle lease and finance arrangements. Further, sales of vehicles in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to increased volatility as we expand and adjust our operations. Moreover, as additional competitors enter the marketplace and help bring the world closer to sustainable transportation, we will have to adjust and continue to execute well to maintain our momentum. These macroeconomic and industry trends have had, and will likely continue to have, an impact on the pricing of, and order rate for our vehicles, and we will continue to adjust accordingly to such developments. Automotive—Deliveries and Customer Infrastructure As our production increases, we must work constantly to similarly increase vehicle delivery capability so that it does not become a bottleneck on our total deliveries. Beginning the second half of 2022, due to continuing challenges caused by vehicle transportation capacity during peak delivery periods, we began transitioning to a more even regional mix of vehicle builds each week, which led to an increase in cars in transit at the end of the year. Increasing the exports of vehicles manufactured at Gigafactory Shanghai has also been effective in mitigating the strain on our deliveries in markets outside of the United States, and we expect to benefit further from situating additional factories closer to local markets, including the production launch at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Austin. As we expand our manufacturing operations globally, we will also have to continue to increase and staff our delivery, servicing and charging infrastructure accordingly, maintain our vehicle reliability and optimize our Supercharger locations to ensure cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction. In particular, we remain focused on increasing the capability and efficiency of our servicing operations. Energy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment The long-term success of this business is dependent upon increasing margins through greater volumes. We continue to increase the production of our energy storage products to meet high levels of demand. For Megapack, energy storage deployments can vary meaningfully quarter to quarter depending on the timing of specific project milestones. For Powerwall, better availability and growing grid stability concerns drive higher customer interest. We remain committed to growing our retrofit solar energy business by offering a low-cost and simplified online ordering experience. In addition, we continue to seek to improve our installation capabilities and price efficiencies for Solar Roof. As these product lines grow, we will have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage products and hire additional personnel, particularly skilled electricians, to support the ramp of Solar Roof. 33 Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends Our capital expenditures are typically difficult to project beyond the short-term given the number and breadth of our core projects at any given time, and may further be impacted by uncertainties in future global market conditions. We are simultaneously ramping new products, ramping manufacturing facilities on three continents and piloting the development and manufacture of new battery cell technologies, and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending on overall priority among projects, the pace at which we meet milestones, production adjustments to and among our various products, increased capital efficiencies and the addition of new projects. Owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced projects under development, all other continuing infrastructure growth and varying levels of inflation, we currently expect our capital expenditures to be between $6.00 to $8.00 billion in 2023 and between $7.00 to $9.00 billion in each of the following two fiscal years. Our business has recently been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend, and with better working capital management resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding, our sales growth is also facilitating positive cash generation. We have and will continue to utilize such cash flows, among other things, to do more vertical integration, expand our product roadmap and provide financing options to our customers. On the other hand, we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods depending on the specific pace of our capital-intensive projects and rising material prices and increasing supply chain and labor expenses resulting from changes in global trade conditions and labor availability associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, we expect our ability to be self-funding to continue as long as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales. Operating Expense Trends As long as we see expanding sales, and excluding the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions including increased labor costs and impairment charges on certain assets as explained below, we generally expect operating expenses relative to revenues to decrease as we continue to increase operational efficiency and process automation. We expect operating expenses to continue to grow in 2023 as we are expanding our operations globally. In the first quarter of 2021, we invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin. As with any investment and consistent with how we manage fiat-based cash and cash-equivalent accounts, we may increase or decrease our holdings of digital assets at any time based on the needs of the business and our view of market and environmental conditions. Digital assets are considered indefinite-lived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules. Accordingly, any decrease in their fair values below our carrying values for such assets at any time subsequent to their acquisition will require us to recognize impairment charges, whereas we may make no upward revisions for any market price increases until a sale. For any digital assets held now or in the future, these charges may negatively impact our profitability in the periods in which such impairments occur even if the overall market values of these assets increase. For example, in the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded $204 million of impairment losses resulting from changes to the carrying value of our bitcoin and gains of $64 million on certain conversions of bitcoin into fiat currency by us. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected. The estimates used for, but not limited to, determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements, sales return reserves, the collectability of accounts and financing receivables, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of financial instruments, fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted. We have assessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 34 Revenue Recognition Automotive Sales Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), including access to our FSD features, internet connectivity, Supercharger network and over-the-air software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business, except sales we finance for which payments are collected over the contractual loan term. We also recognize a sales return reserve based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values, when we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms. Other features and services such as access to our internet connectivity, legacy programs offering unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. Other limited free Supercharging incentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is earlier. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer and the portion related to software updates is recognized over time. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available. Any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue. Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles. As our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue, and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles, parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts. We offer resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to certain international customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners. Under these programs, we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period, which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program, for a pre-determined resale value. We account for such automotive sales as a sale with a right of return when we do not believe the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them at contract inception. The process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s economic incentive to exercise. On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market values of vehicles sold with resale value guarantees to determine whether there have been changes to the likelihood of future product returns. As we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there may be material changes to their estimated values. Inventory Valuation Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy products, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off. We also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may be required. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results. 35 Warranties We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales, and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our automotive business, accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment. Stock-Based Compensation We use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted to employees and for our employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period. For performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable. As we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and development expense and Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Income Taxes We are subject to taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. We make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans. Tax laws, regulations and administrative practices may be subject to change due to economic or political conditions including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. The U.S., many countries in the European Union and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard. As of December 31, 2022, we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net U.S. deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our U.S. deferred tax assets will not be realized. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted. Furthermore, significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain. As a result, we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes or taxes payable based on our estimates of the eventual outcome. These effects are recognized when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that some of those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. We are required to file income tax returns in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions, which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions. Such returns are subject to audit by the various federal, state and foreign taxing authorities, who may disagree with respect to our tax positions. We believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors, including past experience and interpretations of tax law. We review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations, such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made. The eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is made. 36 Results of Operations Revenues Year Ended December 31, 2022 vs. 2021 Change 2021 vs. 2020 Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 $ % $ % Automotive sales $ 67,210 $ 44,125 $ 24,604 $ 23,085 52 % $ 19,521 79 % Automotive regulatory credits 1,776 1,465 1,580 311 21 % (115 ) (7 )% Automotive leasing 2,476 1,642 1,052 834 51 % 590 56 % Total automotive revenues 71,462 47,232 27,236 24,230 51 % 19,996 73 % Services and other 6,091 3,802 2,306 2,289 60 % 1,496 65 % Total automotive & services and other segment revenue 77,553 51,034 29,542 26,519 52 % 21,492 73 % Energy generation and storage segment revenue 3,909 2,789 1,994 1,120 40 % 795 40 % Total revenues $ 81,462 $ 53,823 $ 31,536 $ 27,639 51 % $ 22,287 71 % Automotive & Services and Other Segment Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new Model S, Model X, Semi, Model 3, and Model Y vehicles, including access to our FSD features, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air software updates. These deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting. Automotive regulatory credits includes sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers. Our revenue from automotive regulatory credits is directly related to our new vehicle production, sales and pricing negotiated with our customers. We monetize them proactively as new vehicles are sold based on standing arrangements with buyers of such credits, typically as close as possible to the production and delivery of the vehicle or changes in regulation impacting the credits. Automotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for vehicles under direct operating lease agreements. Additionally, automotive leasing revenue includes direct sales-type leasing programs where we recognize all revenue associated with the sales-type lease upon delivery to the customer. Services and other revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle services and parts, paid Supercharging, sales of used vehicles, retail merchandise and vehicle insurance revenue. 2022 compared to 2021 Automotive sales revenue increased $23.09 billion, or 52%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase of 347,024 Model 3 and Model Y deliveries, and an increase of 38,183 Model S and Model X deliveries year over year. This was achieved from production ramping of Model Y at Gigafactory Shanghai and the Fremont Factory as well as the start of production at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas in 2022, at a higher combined average selling price from a higher proportion of Model Y sales despite a negative impact from the United States dollar strengthening against other foreign currencies in 2022 compared to the prior period. There was also an increase in production of Model S and Model X and an increase in the combined average selling price of Model S and Model X with a higher proportion of Model X sales, compared to the prior period as deliveries of the new versions of Model S and Model X began ramping in the second and fourth quarters of 2021, respectively. Further, during the fourth quarter of 2022, we recognized $324 million in revenue related to the general FSD feature release in North America. Automotive regulatory credits revenue increased $311 million, or 21%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to changes in regulation which entitled us to additional consideration of $288 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2022 for credits sold previously, in the absence of which we had only an immaterial increase in automotive regulatory credits revenue. Automotive leasing revenue increased $834 million, or 51%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The change is primarily due to an increase in activities under our direct operating lease program as well as an increase in direct sales-type leasing revenue. Services and other revenue increased $2.29 billion, or 60%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The change is primarily due to increase in used vehicle revenue driven by increases in volume and average selling prices of used Tesla and non-Tesla vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continues to grow, paid Supercharging revenue, insurance services revenue and retail merchandise revenue. 37 Energy Generation and Storage Segment Energy generation and storage revenue includes sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products, financing of solar energy generation products, services related to such products and sales of solar energy systems incentives. 2022 compared to 2021 Energy generation and storage revenue increased $1.12 billion, or 40%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in energy storage deployments of Megapack, Powerwall and higher average selling price of Megapack, as well as on solar cash and loan deployments driven by price increases in 2022. Cost of Revenues and Gross Margin Year Ended December 31, 2022 vs. 2021 Change 2021 vs. 2020 Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 $ % $ % Cost of revenues Automotive sales $ 49,599 $ 32,415 $ 19,696 $ 17,184 53 % $ 12,719 65 % Automotive leasing 1,509 978 563 531 54 % 415 74 % Total automotive cost of revenues 51,108 33,393 20,259 17,715 53 % 13,134 65 % Services and other 5,880 3,906 2,671 1,974 51 % 1,235 46 % Total automotive & services and other segment cost of revenues 56,988 37,299 22,930 19,689 53 % 14,369 63 % Energy generation and storage segment 3,621 2,918 1,976 703 24 % 942 48 % Total cost of revenues $ 60,609 $ 40,217 $ 24,906 $ 20,392 51 % $ 15,311 61 % Gross profit total automotive $ 20,354 $ 13,839 $ 6,977 Gross margin total automotive 28.5 % 29.3 % 25.6 % Gross profit total automotive & services and other segment $ 20,565 $ 13,735 $ 6,612 Gross margin total automotive & services and other segment 26.5 % 26.9 % 22.4 % Gross profit energy generation and storage segment $ 288 $ (129 ) $ 18 Gross margin energy generation and storage segment 7.4 % (4.6 )% 0.9 % Total gross profit $ 20,853 $ 13,606 $ 6,630 Total gross margin 25.6 % 25.3 % 21.0 % Automotive & Services and Other Segment Cost of automotive sales revenue includes direct and indirect materials, labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including depreciation costs of tooling and machinery, shipping and logistic costs, vehicle connectivity costs, allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our free Supercharging programs and reserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of automotive sales revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. Cost of automotive leasing revenue includes the depreciation of operating lease vehicles, cost of goods sold associated with direct sales-type leases and warranty expense related to leased vehicles. Cost of automotive leasing revenue also includes vehicle connectivity costs and allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network for vehicles under our leasing programs. Cost of services and other revenue includes costs associated with providing non-warranty after-sales services and parts, costs of paid Supercharging, cost of used vehicles including refurbishment costs, costs for retail merchandise, and costs to provide vehicle insurance. 38 2022 compared to 2021 Cost of automotive sales revenue increased $17.18 billion, or 53%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, in line with the growth in revenue year over year, as discussed above. The average combined cost per unit of Model 3 and Model Y increased year over year due to rising raw material, logistics and warranty costs. There were also idle capacity charges of $306 million primarily related to the temporary suspension of production at Gigafactory Shanghai as well as the ramping up of production in Gigafactory Texas and our proprietary battery cells manufacturing during the year ended December 31, 2022. We had also incurred costs related to the ramp up of production in Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg during the year ended December 31, 2022. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in combined average Model S and Model X costs per unit driven by lower average cost for the new versions from ramping up production. Further, these increases in costs of revenue were positively impacted by the United States dollar strengthening against other foreign currencies in 2022 compared to the prior period. Cost of automotive leasing revenue increased $531 million, or 54%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct operating lease program and an increase in direct sales-type leasing cost of revenues from more activities in the current year. Cost of services and other revenue increased $1.97 billion, or 51%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The change is primarily due to an increase in used vehicle cost of revenue driven by increases in volume and costs of used Tesla and non-Tesla vehicle sales, an increase in non-warranty maintenance service revenue, and an increase in costs of paid Supercharging, insurance services and retail merchandise. Gross margin for total automotive decreased from 29.3% to 28.5% in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. This was driven by the changes in automotive sales revenue and cost of automotive sales revenue, partially offset by an increase in regulatory credits revenue, as discussed earlier. Gross margin for total automotive & services and other segment decreased from 26.9% to 26.5% in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the automotive gross margin decrease discussed above, partially offset by an improvement in our services and other gross margin. Additionally, services and other was a higher percentage of the segment gross margin during the year ended 2022 as compared to the prior year. Energy Generation and Storage Segment Cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, warehouse rent, freight, warranty expense, other overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets. Cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. In agreements for solar energy system and PPAs where we are the lessor, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems, maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs. 2022 compared to 2021 Cost of energy generation and storage revenue increased $703 million, or 24%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to increases in energy storage deployments of Megapack and Powerwall, as well as higher average cost of solar cash and loan deployments due to increased component costs. Gross margin for energy generation and storage increased from -4.6% to 7.4% in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. This was driven by the growth in energy generation and storage revenue and cost of energy generation and storage revenue as discussed above. Additionally, there was a higher proportion of energy storage sales, which operated at a higher gross margin, within the segment. 39 Research and Development Expense Year Ended December 31, 2022 vs. 2021 Change 2021 vs. 2020 Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 $ % $ % Research and development $ 3,075 $ 2,593 $ 1,491 $ 482 19 % $ 1,102 74 % As a percentage of revenues 4 % 5 % 5 % Research and development (“R&D”) expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and research, manufacturing engineering and manufacturing test organizations, prototyping expense, contract and professional services and amortized equipment expense. R&D expenses increased $482 million, or 19%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to a $175 million increase in employee and labor related expenses, a $132 million increase in facilities, outside services, freight and depreciation expense, a $101 million increase in R&D expensed materials and an $87 million increase in stock-based compensation expense. These increases were to support our expanding product roadmap and technologies including our proprietary battery cells. Further, there were additional R&D expenses in the first quarter of 2022 as we were in the pre-production phase at Gigafactory Texas and started production at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg only closer to the end of the first quarter of 2022. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 5% to 4% in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Our R&D expenses have decreased as a proportion of total revenues despite expanding product roadmap and technologies. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Year Ended December 31, 2022 vs. 2021 Change 2021 vs. 2020 Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 $ % $ % Selling, general and administrative $ 3,946 $ 4,517 $ 3,145 $ (571 ) (13 )% $ 1,372 44 % As a percentage of revenues 5 % 8 % 10 % Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses generally consist of personnel and facilities costs related to our stores, marketing, sales, executive, finance, human resources, information technology and legal organizations, as well as fees for professional and contract services and litigation settlements. SG&A expenses decreased $571 million, or 13%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. This is primarily due to a decrease of $822 million in stock-based compensation expense, most of which is attributable to the lower stock-based compensation expense of $844 million on the 2018 CEO Performance Award. This was partially offset by the overall growth in stock-based compensation due to increased headcount. See Note 13, Equity Incentive Plans , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. There was also a decrease of $87 million in overall employee and labor related expenses driven by a decrease of $340 million of additional payroll tax due to our CEO's option exercises from the 2012 CEO Performance Award in 2021, partially offset by an increase in other employee and labor costs from increased headcount. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $222 million in facilities-related expenses, and an increase of $117 million in professional services, sales and marketing activities and other costs. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 8% to 5% in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Our SG&A expenses have decreased as a proportion of total revenues due to the decrease in expenses as discussed above, in addition to operational efficiencies. Restructuring and Other Expense Year Ended December 31, 2022 vs. 2021 Change 2021 vs. 2020 Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 $ % $ % Restructuring and other $ 176 $ (27 ) $ — $ 203 Not meaningful $ (27 ) Not meaningful During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded $204 million and $101 million, respectively, of impairment losses on digital assets, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we also realized gains of $64 million and $128 million, respectively, in connection with converting our holdings of digital assets into fiat currency. See Note 3, Digital Assets, Net , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. Additionally, we recorded other expenses of $36 million during the second quarter of the year ended December 31, 2022, related to employee terminations. 40 Interest Income Year Ended December 31, 2022 vs. 2021 Change 2021 vs. 2020 Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 $ % $ % Interest income $ 297 $ 56 $ 30 $ 241 430 % $ 26 87 % Interest income increased $241 million, or 430%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to higher interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments during the year ended 2022 compared to the prior period. This was driven by an increase in our average cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balance and rising interest rates. Interest Expense Year Ended December 31, 2022 vs. 2021 Change 2021 vs. 2020 Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 $ % $ % Interest expense $ (191 ) $ (371 ) $ (748 ) $ 180 (49 )% $ 377 (50 )% Interest expense decreased $180 million, or 49%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease was primarily due to the continued reduction in our overall debt balance offset by lower capitalized interest. See Note 11, Debt , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. Other (Expense) Income, Net Year Ended December 31, 2022 vs. 2021 Change 2021 vs. 2020 Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 $ % $ % Other (expense) income, net $ (43 ) $ 135 $ (122 ) $ (178 ) Not meaningful $ 257 Not meaningful Other (expense) income, net, consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses related to our foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities. We expect our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates. Other (expense) income, net, changed unfavorably by $178 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The change is primarily due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Provision for Income Taxes Year Ended December 31, 2022 vs. 2021 Change 2021 vs. 2020 Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 $ % $ % Provision for income taxes $ 1,132 $ 699 $ 292 $ 433 62 % $ 407 139 % Effective tax rate 8 % 11 % 25 % Our provision for income taxes increased by $433 million, or 62%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the increase in our pre-tax income year over year. Our effective tax rate decreased from 11% to 8% in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to changes in mix of jurisdictional earnings. See Note 14, Income Taxes , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Year Ended December 31, 2022 vs. 2021 Change 2021 vs. 2020 Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 $ % $ % Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries $ 31 $ 125 $ 141 $ (94 ) (75 )% $ (16 ) (11 )% 41 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests decreased by $94 million, or 75%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. These changes were due to a decrease in allocations to financing fund investors. Liquidity and Capital Resources We expect to continue to generate net positive operating cash flow as we have done in the last four fiscal years. The cash we generate from our core operations enables us to fund ongoing operations and production, our research and development projects for new products and technologies including our proprietary battery cells, additional manufacturing ramps at existing manufacturing facilities such as the Fremont Factory, Gigafactory Nevada, Gigafactory Shanghai and Gigafactory New York, the ramp of Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas and the continued expansion of our retail and service locations, body shops, Mobile Service fleet, Supercharger network and energy product installation capabilities. In addition, because a large portion of our future expenditures will be to fund our growth, we expect that if needed we will be able to adjust our capital and operating expenditures by operating segment. For example, if our near-term manufacturing operations decrease in scale or ramp more slowly than expected, including due to global economic or business conditions, we may choose to correspondingly slow the pace of our capital expenditures. Finally, we continually evaluate our cash needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital or seek alternative financing sources to fund the rapid growth of our business, including through drawdowns on existing or new debt facilities or financing funds. Conversely, we may also from time to time determine that it is in our best interests to voluntarily repay certain indebtedness early. Accordingly, we believe that our current sources of funds will provide us with adequate liquidity during the 12-month period following December 31, 2022, as well as in the long-term. See the sections below for more details regarding the material requirements for cash in our business and our sources of liquidity to meet such needs. Material Cash Requirements From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with vendors for the purchase of components and raw materials to be used in the manufacture of our products. However, due to contractual terms, variability in the precise growth curves of our development and production ramps, and opportunities to renegotiate pricing, we generally do not have binding and enforceable purchase orders under such contracts beyond the short-term, and the timing and magnitude of purchase orders beyond such period is difficult to accurately project. As discussed in and subject to the considerations referenced in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Management Opportunities, Challenges and Risks and 2023 Outlook—Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we currently expect our capital expenditures to support our projects globally to be between $6.00 to $8.00 billion in 2023 and between $7.00 to $9.00 billion in each of the following two fiscal years. In connection with our operations at Gigafactory New York, we have an agreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31, 2029 (pursuant to a deferral of our required timelines to meet such obligations that was granted in April 2021, and which was memorialized in an amendment to our agreement with the SUNY Foundation in August 2021). We also have an operating lease arrangement with the local government of Shanghai pursuant to which we are required to spend RMB 14.08 billion in capital expenditures at Gigafactory Shanghai by the end of 2023. For details regarding these obligations, refer to Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2022, we and our subsidiaries had outstanding $2.06 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness, of which $1.02 billion is scheduled to become due in the succeeding 12 months. As of December 31, 2022, our total minimum lease payments was $4.28 billion, of which $1.14 billion is due in the succeeding 12 months. For details regarding our indebtedness and lease obligations, refer to Note 11, Debt , and Note 12, Leases , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Sources and Conditions of Liquidity Our sources to fund our material cash requirements are predominantly from our deliveries and servicing of new and used vehicles, sales and installations of our energy storage products and solar energy systems, proceeds from debt facilities and proceeds from equity offerings, when applicable. 42 As of December 31, 2022, we had $16.25 billion and $5.93 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, respectively. Balances held in foreign currencies had a U.S. dollar equivalent of $3.42 billion and consisted primarily of Chinese yuan, euros and British pounds. In addition, we had $2.42 billion of unused committed amounts under our credit facilities as of December 31, 2022, which included $2.27 billion under our Credit Agreement which was terminated in January 2023. Certain of such unused committed amounts are subject to satisfying specified conditions prior to draw-down (such as pledging to our lenders sufficient amounts of qualified receivables, inventories, leased vehicles and our interests in those leases, solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts or various other assets). In January 2023, we entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility providing for a commitment of up to $5.0 billion. For details regarding our indebtedness, refer to Note 11 , Debt , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We continue adapting our strategy to meet our liquidity and risk objectives, such as investing in U.S. government and other investments, to do more vertical integration, expand our product roadmap and provide financing options to our customers. Summary of Cash Flows Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 14,724 $ 11,497 $ 5,943 Net cash used in investing activities $ (11,973 ) $ (7,868 ) $ (3,132 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities $ (3,527 ) $ (5,203 ) $ 9,973 Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as research and development and selling, general and administrative and working capital. Our operating cash inflows include cash from vehicle sales and related servicing, customer lease and financing payments, customer deposits, cash from sales of regulatory credits and energy generation and storage products. These cash inflows are offset by our payments to suppliers for production materials and parts used in our manufacturing process, operating expenses, operating lease payments and interest payments on our financings. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $3.23 billion to $14.72 billion during the year ended December 31, 2022 from $11.50 billion during the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to the increase in net income excluding non-cash expenses, gains and losses of $7.65 billion, offset by the overall increase in net operating assets and liabilities of $4.43 billion. The increase in our net operating assets and liabilities was mainly driven by a larger increase of inventory in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, partially offset by a larger increase of accounts payable and accrued liabilities, to support the ramp up in production at our factories and larger increases in other non-current assets and prepaid expenses and other current assets. Additionally, the increase in our net operating assets and other liabilities was partially offset by a larger increase in other long-term liabilities as compared to the prior year. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Cash flows from investing activities and their variability across each period related primarily to capital expenditures, which were $7.16 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 and $6.48 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, mainly for the expansions of Gigafactory Texas, the Fremont Factory, Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg, and Gigafactory Shanghai. We also purchased $5.84 billion of investments in the year ended December 31, 2022. Additionally, cash inflows related to sales of digital assets were $936 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, and net cash outflows related to digital assets were $1.23 billion in the year ended December 31, 2021 from purchases of digital assets for $1.50 billion offset by proceeds from sales of digital assets of $272 million. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities decreased by $1.68 billion to $3.53 billion during the year ended December 31, 2022 from $5.20 billion during the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a $1.92 billion decrease in repayments of convertible and other debt, net of proceeds from issuances of debt. See Note 11, Debt , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding our debt obligations. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 43 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Risk We transact business globally in multiple currencies and hence have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, costs of revenue, operating expenses and localized subsidiary debt denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (primarily the Chinese yuan, euro, pound sterling and Norwegian krone in relation to our current year operations). In general, we are a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar for our foreign subsidiaries. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars as we do not typically hedge foreign currency risk. We have also experienced, and will continue to experience, fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local currency (primarily consisting of our intercompany and cash and cash equivalents balances). We considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is reasonably possible that adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near-term. These changes were applied to our total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our local currencies at the balance sheet date to compute the impact these changes would have had on our net income before income taxes. These changes would have resulted in a gain or loss of $473 million at December 31, 2022 and $277 million at December 31, 2021, assuming no foreign currency hedging. 44 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Index to Consolidated Financial Statements Page Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID: 238 ) 46 Consolidated Balance Sheets 48 Consolidated Statements of Operations 49 Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income 50 Consolidated Statements of Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests and Equity 51 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows 52 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 53 45 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Tesla, Inc. Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tesla, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of redeemable noncontrolling interests and equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Changes in Accounting Principles As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for convertible debt in 2021. Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 46 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Automotive Warranty Reserve As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, total accrued warranty, which primarily relates to the automotive segment, was $3,505 million as of December 31, 2022. The Company provides a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles. A warranty reserve is accrued for these products sold, which includes management’s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranty and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the automotive warranty reserve is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in determining the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models; this in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures to evaluate management’s significant assumptions related to the nature, frequency and costs of future claims for certain Tesla vehicle models, and the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s estimate of the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models, including controls over management’s significant assumptions related to the nature, frequency and costs of future claims as well as the completeness and accuracy of actual claims incurred to date. These procedures also included, among others, performing one of the following: (i) testing management’s process for determining the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models or (ii) developing an independent estimate of the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models and comparing the independent estimate to management’s estimate to evaluate the reasonableness of the estimate. Testing management’s process involved evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions related to the nature and frequency of future claims and the related costs to repair or replace items under warranty. Evaluating the assumptions related to the nature and frequency of future claims and the related costs to repair or replace items under warranty involved evaluating whether the assumptions used were reasonable by performing a lookback analysis comparing prior period forecasted claims to actual claims incurred. Developing the independent estimate involved testing the completeness and accuracy of historical vehicle claims processed and testing that such claims were appropriately used by management in the estimation of future claims. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in developing an independent estimate of the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models and in evaluating the appropriateness of certain aspects of management’s significant assumptions related to the nature and frequency of future claims. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP San Jose, California January 30, 2023 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2005. 47 Tesla, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 – Overview Tesla, Inc. (“Tesla”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 1, 2003. We design, develop, manufacture, sell and lease high-performance fully electric vehicles and energy generation and storage systems, and offer services related to our products. Our Chief Executive Officer, as the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), organizes our company, manages resource allocations and measures performance among two operating and reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and stor age. Since the first quarter of 2020, there has been a worldwide impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as an easing of restrictions on social, business, travel and government activities and functions. There are ongoing global impacts resulting from the pandemic, and we have been affected by temporary manufacturing closures, employment and compensation adjustments and impediments to administrative activities supporting our product deliveries and deployments. In addition, we have experienced and are experiencing the impacts of varying levels of inflation caused by the COVID‐19 pandemic and general global economic conditions. On August 5, 2022, we increased the number of authorized shares of common stock by 4,000,000,000 shares and our Board of Directors declared the 2022 Stock Split. Each stockholder of record on August 17, 2022 received a dividend of two additional shares of common stock for each then-held share, distributed after close of trading on August 24, 2022. All share and per share amounts presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the impact of the 2022 Stock Split. Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and reflect our accounts and operations and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. In accordance with the provisions of ASC 810, Consolidation (“ASC 810”), we consolidate any variable interest entity (“VIE”) of which we are the primary beneficiary. We have formed VIEs with financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes associated with solar energy systems and leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs. The typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity; however, a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as VIEs, through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests. ASC 810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We do not consolidate a VIE in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not considered the primary beneficiary. We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of all the VIEs (see Note 16 , Variable Interest Entity Arrangements ). We evaluate our relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures in the accompanying notes. The estimates used for, but not limited to, determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements, sales return reserves, the collectability of accounts and finance receivables, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of financial instruments, fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted. We have assessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Reclassifications Certain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. 53 Revenue Recognition Revenue by source The following table disaggregates our revenue by major source (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Automotive sales (1) $ 67,210 $ 44,125 $ 24,604 Automotive regulatory credits 1,776 1,465 1,580 Energy generation and storage sales 3,376 2,279 1,477 Services and other 6,091 3,802 2,306 Total revenues from sales and services 78,453 51,671 29,967 Automotive leasing 2,476 1,642 1,052 Energy generation and storage leasing 533 510 517 Total revenues $ 81,462 $ 53,823 $ 31,536 (1) Pricing adjustments on our vehicle offerings can impact the estimate of likelihood that customers would exercise their resale value guarantees, resulting in an adjustment of our sales return reserve on vehicles sold with resale value guarantees. Actual return rates being lower than expected and increases in resale values of our vehicles in 2021 resulted in a net release of our reserve of $ 365 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which represented increases in automotive sales revenue. The net release or increase of reserves which impacted automotive sales revenue were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2020. Further, $ 324 million of the total revenue recognized as of December 31, 2022 is related to the general FSD feature release in North America in the fourth quarter of 2022. Automotive Segment Automotive Sales Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under ASC 606, including access to our FSD features, internet connectivity, Supercharger network and over-the-air software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business, except sales we finance for which payments are collected over the contractual loan term. We also recognize a sales return reserve based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values, when we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms. Other features and services such as access to our internet connectivity, legacy programs offering unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. Other limited free Supercharging incentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is earlier. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer and the portion related to software updates is recognized over time. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available. Any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue. Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles. As our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue, and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles, parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts. 54 We offer resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to certain international customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners. Under these programs, we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period, which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program, for a pre-determined resale value. We account for such automotive sales as a sale with a right of return when we do not believe the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them at contract inception. The process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s economic incentive to exercise. On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market values of vehicles sold with resale value guarantees to determine whether there have been changes to the likelihood of future product returns. As we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there may be material changes to their estimated values. The total sales return reserve on vehicles sold with resale value guarantees was $ 91 million and $ 223 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, of which $ 40 million and $ 91 million was short-term, respectively. Deferred revenue related to the access to our FSD features, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air software updates primarily on automotive sales consisted of the following (in millions): Year ended December 31, 2022 2021 Deferred revenue— beginning of period $ 2,382 $ 1,926 Additions 1,178 847 Net changes in liability for pre-existing contracts ( 67 ) ( 25 ) Revenue recognized ( 580 ) ( 366 ) Deferred revenue— end of period $ 2,913 $ 2,382 Deferred revenue is equivalent to the total transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, as of the balance sheet date. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2021 was $ 472 million as of December 31, 2022, primarily related to the general FSD feature release in North America in the fourth quarter of 2022. We had recognized revenue of $ 312 million from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2020, for the year ended December 31, 2021. Of the total deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2022, we expect to recognize $ 639 million of revenue in the next 12 months. The remaining balance will be recognized at the time of transfer of control of the product or over the performance period as discussed above in Automotive Sales. We have been providing loans for financing our automotive deliveries during the year ended December 31, 2022. We have recorded net financing receivables on the consolidated balance sheets, of which $ 128 million is recorded within Accounts receivable, net, for the current portion and $ 665 million is recorded within Other non-current assets for the long-term portion, as of December 31, 2022. Automotive Regulatory Credits We earn tradable credits in the operation of our automotive business under various regulations related to ZEVs, greenhouse gas, fuel economy and clean fuel. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements. Payments for automotive regulatory credits are typically received at the point control transfers to the customer, or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. We recognize revenue on the sale of automotive regulatory credits, which have negligible incremental costs associated with them, at the time control of the regulatory credits is transferred to the purchasing party. Deferred revenue related to sales of automotive regulatory credits was immaterial as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2022 , we had also recognized $ 288 million in revenue due to changes in regulation which entitled us to additional consideration for credits sold previously. 55 Automotive Leasing Revenue Direct Vehicle Operating Leasing Program We have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle operating leasing programs in the U.S., Canada and in certain countries in Europe. Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to 48 months. At the end of the lease term, customers are generally required to return the vehicles to us. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases. We record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the contractual term, and we record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized $ 1.75 billion, $ 1.25 billion and $ 752 million of direct vehicle leasing revenue, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had deferred $ 407 million and $ 392 million, respectively, of lease-related upfront payments, which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual terms of the individual leases. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts. Direct Sales-Type Leasing Program We have outstanding direct leases and vehicles financed by us under loan arrangements accounted for as sales-type leases under ASC 842, Leases (“ASC 842”), in certain countries in Asia and Europe. Depending on the specific program, customers may or may not have a right to return the vehicle to us during or at the end of the lease term. If the customer does not have a right to return, the customer will take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all contractual payments. Under the programs for which there is a right to return, the purchase option is reasonably certain to be exercised by the lessee and we therefore expect the customer to take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all contractual payments. Our arrangements under these programs can have terms for up to 72 months. We recognize all revenue and costs associated with the sales-type lease as automotive leasing revenue and automotive leasing cost of revenue, respectively, upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer. Interest income based on the implicit rate in the lease is recorded to automotive leasing revenue over time as customers are invoiced on a monthly basis. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized $ 683 million, $ 369 million and $ 120 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing revenue and $ 427 million, $ 234 million and $ 87 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing cost of revenue. Services and Other Revenue Services and other revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle services and parts, sales of used vehicles, paid Supercharging, retail merchandise and vehicle insurance revenue. Revenues related to repair and maintenance services are recognized over time as services are provided and extended service plans are recognized over the performance period of the service contract as the obligation represents a stand-ready obligation to the customer. We sell used vehicles, services, service plans, vehicle components and merchandise separately and thus use standalone selling prices as the basis for revenue allocation to the extent that these items are sold in transactions with other performance obligations. Payment for used vehicles, services, and merchandise are typically received at the point when control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. Payments received for prepaid plans are refundable upon customer cancellation of the related contracts and are included within Customer deposits on the consolidated balance sheets. Deferred revenue related to services and other revenue was immaterial as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Energy Generation and Storage Segment Energy Generation and Storage Sales Energy generation and storage sales revenue consists of the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems to residential, small commercial, large commercial and utility grade customers. Sales of solar energy systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the engineering, design and installation of the system. Residential and small scale commercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy system upfront. Revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when control transfers, which is when we install a solar energy system and the system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction. Sales of energy storage systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers, which is when the product has been delivered or, if we are performing installation, when installed and commissioned. Payment for such storage systems is made upon invoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. For large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales which consist of the engineering, design and installation of the system, customers make milestone payments that are consistent with contract-specific phases of a project. Revenue from such contracts is recognized over time using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a percentage of total estimated contract costs for energy storage system sales and as a percentage of total estimated labor hours for solar energy system sales. 56 In instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract, we allocate the consideration to the various obligations in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price method. Standalone selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs plus margin or by using market data for comparable products. Costs incurred on the sale of residential installations before the solar energy systems are completed are included as work in process within inventory in the consolidated balance sheets. Any fees that are paid or payable by us to a solar loan lender would be recognized as an offset against revenue. Costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to commissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems. As our contract costs related to solar energy system and energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred. As part of our solar energy system and energy storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or energy performance requirements specified in the contract. In certain instances, we may receive a bonus payment if the system performs above a specified level. Conversely, if a solar energy system or energy storage system does not meet the performance guarantee requirements, we may be required to pay liquidated damages. Other forms of variable consideration related to our large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system contracts include variable customer payments that will be made based on our energy market participation activities. Such guarantees and variable customer payments represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data becomes available. Such estimates are included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal of revenue will not occur. We record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are collected from customers related to fees charged for prepayments, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to $ 863 million and $ 399 million, respectively, mainly due to milestone payments. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $ 171 million and $ 93 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We have elected the practical expedient to omit disclosure of the amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for energy generation and storage sales with an original expected contract length of one year or less and the amount that we have the right to invoice when that amount corresponds directly with the value of the performance to date. As of December 31, 2022, total transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than one year was $ 210 million. Of this amount, we expect to recognize $ 12 million in the next 12 months and the remaining over a period up to 25 years. We have been providing loans for financing our energy generation products during the year ended December 31, 2022. We have recorded net financing receivables on the consolidated balance sheets, of which $ 24 million is recorded within Accounts receivable, net, for the current portion and $ 387 million is recorded within Other non-current assets for the long-term portion, as of December 31, 2022. Energy Generation and Storage Leasing For revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for energy generation and storage products, we record lease revenue from minimum lease payments, including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such systems, on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease term, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The difference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue or deferred asset on the consolidated balance sheet. For solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under PPAs prior to January 1, 2019, we have determined that these agreements should be accounted for as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840, Leases . Revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the contracts, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. We record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers, including lease prepayments, in excess of revenue recognized, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to $ 191 million and $ 198 million, respectively. Deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and incentives received from utility companies and various local and state government agencies, which is recognized as revenue over the lease term. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, deferred revenue from rebates and incentives amounted to $ 25 million and $ 27 million, respectively. We capitalize initial direct costs from the execution of agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs, which include the referral fees and sales commissions, as an element of solar energy systems, net, and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related agreements. 57 Cost of Revenues Automotive Segment Automotive Sales Cost of automotive sales revenue includes direct and indirect materials, labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including depreciation costs of tooling and machinery, shipping and logistic costs, vehicle connectivity costs, allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network and reserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of automotive sales revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. Automotive Leasing Cost of automotive leasing revenue includes the depreciation of operating lease vehicles, cost of goods sold associated with direct sales-type leases and warranty expense related to leased vehicles. Cost of automotive leasing revenue also includes vehicle connectivity costs and allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network for vehicles under our leasing programs. Services and Other Costs of services and other revenue includes costs associated with providing non-warranty after-sales services and parts, costs of paid Supercharging, cost of used vehicles including refurbishment costs, costs for retail merchandise, and costs to provide vehicle insurance. Energy Generation and Storage Segment Energy Generation and Storage Cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, warehouse rent, freight, warranty expense, other overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets. Cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. In agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs where we are the lessor, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems, maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs. Research and Development Costs Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Income Taxes Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) subjects a U.S. shareholder to tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. Under GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI inclusion as a current period expense or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. We elected the deferred method, under which we recorded the corresponding deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, currently subject to valuation allowance. Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income is comprised of net income and other comprehensive (loss) income. Other comprehensive (loss) income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized net gains and losses on investments that have been excluded from the determination of net income. 58 Stock-Based Compensation We use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and RSUs granted to employees and for our ESPP to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period. For performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable. As we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and development expense and Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent third-party interests in the net assets under certain funding arrangements, or funds, that we have entered into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and vehicles under operating leases. We have determined that the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit-sharing arrangements. We have further determined that the methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the substantive profit-sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”) method. We, therefore, determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the HLBV method, which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. Under the HLBV method, the amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet represent the amounts the third parties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds, assuming the net assets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the third parties. The third parties’ interests in the results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period, after taking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the third parties. However, the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount. The redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these third parties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other assets. For certain funds, there may be significant fluctuations in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries due to changes in the liquidation provisions as time-based milestones are reached. Net Income per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders Basic net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Potentially dilutive shares, which are based on the weighted-average shares of common stock underlying outstanding stock-based awards, warrants and convertible senior notes using the treasury stock method or the if-converted method, as applicable, are included when calculating diluted net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders when their effect is dilutive. Furthermore, in connection with the offerings of our convertible senior notes, we entered into convertible note hedges and warrants (see Note 11, Debt ). However, our convertible note hedges are not included when calculating potentially dilutive shares since their effect is always anti-dilutive. The strike price on the warrants were below our average share price during the period and were included in the tables below. Warrants are included in the weighted-average shares used in computing basic net income per share of common stock in the period(s) they are settled. 59 The following table presents the reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders to net income used in computing basic and diluted net income per share of common stock (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 12,556 $ 5,519 $ 721 Less: Buy-out of noncontrolling interest ( 27 ) ( 5 ) 31 Net income used in computing basic net income per share of common stock 12,583 5,524 690 Less: Dilutive convertible debt ( 1 ) ( 9 ) — Net income used in computing diluted net income per share of common stock $ 12,584 $ 5,533 $ 690 The following table presents the reconciliation of basic to diluted weighted average shares used in computing net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Weighted average shares used in computing net income per share of common stock, basic 3,130 2,959 2,798 Add: Stock-based awards 310 292 198 Convertible senior notes 3 29 141 Warrants 32 106 112 Weighted average shares used in computing net income per share of common stock, diluted 3,475 3,386 3,249 The following table presents the potentially dilutive shares that were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders, because their effect was anti-dilutive, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Stock-based awards 4 1 6 Convertible senior notes (1) — — 3 (1) Under the modified retrospective method of adoption of ASU 2020-06, the dilutive impact of convertible senior notes was calculated using the if-converted method for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Certain convertible senior notes were calculated using the treasury stock method for the year ended December 31, 2020. Business Combinations We account for business acquisitions under ASC 805, Business Combinations . The total purchase consideration for an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets (including intangible assets), liabilities assumed (including contingent liabilities) and noncontrolling interests in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. We recognize goodwill if the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests is in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. We recognize a bargain purchase gain within Other (expense) income, net, in the consolidated statement of operations if the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is in excess of the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests. We include the results of operations of the acquired business in the consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition date. Cash and Cash Equivalents All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered cash equivalents. Our cash equivalents are primarily comprised of money market funds and certificates of deposit. 60 Restricted Cash We maintain certain cash balances restricted as to withdrawal or use. Our restricted cash is comprised primarily of cash held to service certain payments under various secured debt facilities. In addition, restricted cash includes cash held as collateral for certain permits as well as sales to lease partners with a resale value guarantee, letters of credit, real estate leases, deposits held for our insurance services and certain operating leases. We record restricted cash as other assets in the consolidated balance sheets and determine current or non-current classification based on the expected duration of the restriction. Our total cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows, was as follows (in millions): December 31, December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Cash and cash equivalents $ 16,253 $ 17,576 $ 19,384 Restricted cash included in prepaid expenses and other current assets 294 345 238 Restricted cash included in other non-current assets 377 223 279 Total as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows $ 16,924 $ 18,144 $ 19,901 Investments Investments may be comprised of a combination of marketable securities, including U.S. government securities, corporate debt securities, time deposit, and certain certificates of deposit, which are all designated as available-for-sale and reported at estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income which is included within stockholders’ equity. Available-for-sale marketable securities with maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase are included in short-term investments in our consolidated balance sheets. Interest, dividends, amortization and accretion of purchase premiums and discounts on these investments are included within Interest income in our consolidated statements of operations. The cost of available-for-sale investments sold is based on the specific identification method. Realized gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale investments are recorded in Other (expense) income, net. We regularly review all of our investments for declines in fair value. The review includes but is not limited to (i) the consideration of the cause of the decline, (ii) any currently recorded expected credit losses and (iii) the creditworthiness of the respective security issuers. The amortized cost basis of our investments approximates its fair value. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Accounts receivable primarily include amounts related to receivables from financial institutions and leasing companies offering various financing products to our customers, sales of energy generation and storage products, sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers and government rebates already passed through to customers. We provide an allowance against accounts receivable for the amount we expect to be uncollectible. We write-off accounts receivable against the allowance when they are deemed uncollectible. Depending on the day of the week on which the end of a fiscal quarter falls, our accounts receivable balance may fluctuate as we are waiting for certain customer payments to clear through our banking institutions and receipts of payments from our financing partners, which can take up to approximately two weeks based on the contractual payment terms with such partners. Our accounts receivable balances associated with our sales of regulatory credits, which are typically transferred to other manufacturers during the last few days of the quarter, is dependent on contractual payment terms. Additionally, government rebates can take up to a year or more to be collected depending on the customary processing timelines of the specific jurisdictions issuing them. These various factors may have a significant impact on our accounts receivable balance from period to period. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 , we had $ 753 million and $ 627 million, respectively, of long-term government rebates receivable in Other non-current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Financing Receivables We provide financing options to our customers for our automotive and energy products. Financing receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover expected credit losses on the financing receivables. In determining expected credit losses, we consider our historical level of credit losses, current economic trends, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the future cash flows. 61 When originating consumer receivables, we review the credit application, the proposed contract terms, credit bureau information (e.g., FICO score) and other information. Our evaluation emphasizes the applicant’s ability to pay and creditworthiness focusing on payment, affordability, and applicant credit history as key considerations. Generally, all customers in this portfolio have strong creditworthiness at loan origination. After origination, we review the credit quality of retail financing based on customer payment activity and aging analysis. For all financing receivables, we define “past due” as any payment, including principal and interest, which is at least 31 days past the contractual due date. As of December 31, 2022, the majority of our financing receivables were at current status with only an immaterial balance being past due. Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, the majority of our financing receivables, excluding MyPower notes receivable, were originated in 2022. We have customer notes receivable under the legacy MyPower loan program, which provided residential customers with the option to finance the purchase of a solar energy system through a 30 -year loan and were all originated prior to year 2018. The outstanding balances, net of any allowance for expected credit losses, are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total outstanding balance of MyPower customer notes receivable, net of allowance for expected credit losses, was $ 280 million and $ 299 million, respectively, of which $ 7 million and $ 11 million were due in the next 12 months as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the allowance for expected credit losses was $ 37 million and $ 41 million, respectively. Concentration of Risk Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, investments, restricted cash, accounts receivable and other finance receivables. Our cash and investments balances are primarily on deposit at high credit quality financial institutions or invested in money market funds. These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 , no entity represented 10 % or more of our total receivables balance. Supply Risk We are dependent on our suppliers, including single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our products in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these components from these suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Inventory Valuation Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy products, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off. We also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may be required. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results. Operating Lease Vehicles Vehicles that are leased as part of our direct vehicle leasing program are classified as operating lease vehicles at cost less accumulated depreciation. We generally depreciate their cost, less residual value, using the straight-line-method to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the contractual period. The gross cost of operating lease vehicles as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was $ 6.08 billion and $ 5.28 billion, respectively. Operating lease vehicles on the consolidated balance sheets are presented net of accumulated depreciation of $ 1.04 billion and $ 773 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 , respectively. 62 Digital Assets, Net We currently account for all digital assets held as indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other . We have ownership of and control over our digital assets and we may use third-party custodial services to secure it. The digital assets are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently remeasured on the consolidated balance sheet at cost, net of any impairment losses incurred since acquisition. We determine the fair value of our digital assets on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”), based on quoted prices on the active exchange(s) that we have determined is the principal market for such assets (Level I inputs). We perform an analysis each quarter to identify whether events or changes in circumstances, principally decreases in the quoted prices on active exchanges, indicate that it is more likely than not that our digital assets are impaired. In determining if an impairment has occurred, we consider the lowest market price of one unit of digital asset quoted on the active exchange since acquiring the digital asset. When the then current carrying value of a digital asset exceeds the fair value determined each quarter, an impairment loss has occurred with respect to those digital assets in the amount equal to the difference between their carrying values and the prices determined. Impairment losses are recognized within Restructuring and other in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the impairment is identified. Gains are not recorded until realized upon sale(s), at which point they are presented net of any impairment losses for the same digital assets held within Restructuring and other. In determining the gain to be recognized upon sale, we calculate the difference between the sales price and carrying value of the digital assets sold immediately prior to sale. See Note 3, Digital Assets, Net , for further information regarding digital assets. Solar Energy Systems, Net We are the lessor of solar energy systems. Solar energy systems are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, as follows: Solar energy systems in service 30 to 35 years Initial direct costs related to customer solar energy system lease acquisition costs Lease term (up to 25 years ) Solar energy systems pending interconnection will be depreciated as solar energy systems in service when they have been interconnected and placed in-service. Solar energy systems under construction represents systems that are under installation, which will be depreciated as solar energy systems in service when they are completed, interconnected and placed in service. Initial direct costs related to customer solar energy system agreement acquisition costs are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related customer agreements. Property, Plant and Equipment, Net Property, plant and equipment, net, including leasehold improvements, are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is generally computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, as follows: Machinery, equipment, vehicles and office furniture 3 to 15 years Tooling 4 to 7 years Building and building improvements 15 to 30 years Computer equipment and software 3 to 10 years Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related leases. Upon the retirement or sale of our property, plant and equipment, the cost and associated accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheet, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statement of operations. Maintenance and repair expenditures are expensed as incurred while major improvements that increase the functionality, output or expected life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated ratably over the identified useful life. Interest expense on outstanding debt is capitalized during the period of significant capital asset construction. Capitalized interest on construction in progress is included within Property, plant and equipment, net and is amortized over the life of the related assets. 63 Long-Lived Assets Including Acquired Intangible Assets We review our property, plant and equipment, solar energy systems, long-term prepayments and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. We measure recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. If the asset is not recoverable, its carrying amount would be adjusted down to its fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we have recognized no material impairments of our long-lived assets. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to thirty years . Goodwill We assess goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired, by comparing its carrying value to the reporting unit’s fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we did no t recognize any impairment of goodwill. Capitalization of Software Costs We capitalize costs incurred in the development of internal use software, during the application development stage to Property, plant and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Such costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life of three years. Software development costs incurred in development of software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed, incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility and prior to the general availability of the software are capitalized when they are expected to become significant. Such costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the applicable software once it is made generally available to our customers. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis, and we test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we have recognized no impairments of capitalized software costs. Foreign Currency We determine the functional and reporting currency of each of our international subsidiaries and their operating divisions based on the primary currency in which they operate. In cases where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, we recognize a cumulative translation adjustment created by the different rates we apply to current period income or loss and the balance sheet. For each subsidiary, we apply the monthly average functional exchange rate to its monthly income or loss and the month-end functional currency rate to translate the balance sheet. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in Other (expense) income, net, in the consolidated statements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded a net foreign currency transaction loss of $ 89 million, gain of $ 97 million and loss of $ 114 million, respectively. 64 Warranties We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years . We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales, and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our automotive business, accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment. Accrued warranty activity consisted of the following (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Accrued warranty—beginning of period $ 2,101 $ 1,468 $ 1,089 Warranty costs incurred ( 803 ) ( 525 ) ( 312 ) Net changes in liability for pre-existing warranties, including expirations and foreign exchange impact 522 102 66 Provision for warranty 1,685 1,056 625 Accrued warranty—end of period $ 3,505 $ 2,101 $ 1,468 Customer Deposits Customer deposits primarily consist of cash payments from customers at the time they place an order or reservation for a vehicle or an energy product and any additional payments up to the point of delivery or the completion of installation. Customer deposits also include prepayments on contracts that can be cancelled without significant penalties, such as vehicle maintenance plans. Customer deposit amounts vary depending on the vehicle model, the energy product and the country of delivery. With the exception of a nominal order fee, customer deposits are fully refundable on vehicles prior to delivery and fully refundable in the case of an energy generation or storage product prior to the entry into a purchase agreement or in certain cases for a limited time thereafter (in accordance with applicable laws). Customer deposits are included in current liabilities until refunded, forfeited or applied towards the customer’s purchase balance. Government Assistance Programs and Incentives Globally, the operation of our business is impacted by various government programs, incentives, and other arrangements. Government incentives are recorded in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with their purpose as a reduction of expense, or an offset to the related capital asset. The benefit is generally recorded when all conditions attached to the incentive have been met or are expected to be met and there is reasonable assurance of their receipt. The government incentives received by us are immaterial in all periods presented since the adoption of ASU 2021-10. Gigafactory New York—New York State Investment and Lease We have a lease through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to designate further buildouts at the facility. We are required to comply with certain covenants, including hiring and cumulative investment targets. Under the terms of the arrangement, the SUNY Foundation paid for a majority of the construction costs related to the manufacturing facility and the acquisition and commissioning of certain manufacturing equipment; and we are responsible for any construction or equipment costs in excess of such amount (refer to Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies ). This incentive reduces the related lease costs of the facility within the Energy generation and storage cost of revenues and operating expense line items in our consolidated statements of operations. 65 Gigafactory Shanghai—Land Use Rights and Economic Benefits We have an agreement with the local government of Shanghai for land use rights at Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the terms of the arrangement, we are required to meet a cumulative capital expenditure target and an annual tax revenue target starting at the end of 2023. In addition, the Shanghai government has granted to our Gigafactory Shanghai subsidiary certain incentives to be used in connection with eligible capital investments at Gigafactory Shanghai (refer to Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies ). For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we received grant funding of $ 76 million and $ 6 million, respectively. These incentives offset the related costs of our facilities and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of the capital investment within the Property, plant and equipment, net line item in our consolidated balance sheets. The incentive therefore reduces the depreciation expense over the useful lives of the related equipment. Nevada Tax Incentives In connection with the construction of Gigafactory Nevada, we entered into agreements with the State of Nevada and Storey County in Nevada that provide abatements for specified taxes, discounts to the base tariff energy rates and transferable tax credits of up to $ 195 million in consideration of capital investment and hiring targets that were met at Gigafactory Nevada. Gigafactory Texas Tax Incentives In connection with the construction of Gigafactory Texas, we entered into a 20 -year agreement with Travis County in Texas pursuant to which we would receive grant funding equal to 70 - 80 % of property taxes paid by us to Travis County and a separate 10 -year agreement with the Del Valle Independent School District in Texas pursuant to which a portion of the taxable value of our property would be capped at a specified amount, in each case subject to our meeting certain minimum economic development metrics through our construction and operations at Gigafactory Texas. This incentive is recorded as a reduction of the related expenses within the Cost of automotive revenues and operating expense line items of our consolidated statements of operations. Defined Contribution Plan We have a 401(k) savings plan in the U.S. that is intended to qualify as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code and a number of savings plans internationally. Under the 401(k) savings plan, participating employees may elect to contribute up to 90 % of their eligible compensation, subject to certain limitations. Beginning in January 2022, we began to match 50 % of each employee’s contributions up to a maximum of 6 % (capped at $ 3,000 ) of the employee’s eligible compensation, vested upon one year of service. We recognized $ 91 million of expenses related to employer contributions for the 401(k) savings plan during the year ended December 31, 2022. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2021-08, Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (Topic 805). This ASU requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities (deferred revenue) from acquired contracts using the revenue recognition guidance in Topic 606. At the acquisition date, the acquirer applies the revenue model as if it had originated the acquired contracts. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption of the ASU should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is also permitted, including adoption in an interim period. If early adopted, the amendments are applied retrospectively to all business combinations for which the acquisition date occurred during the fiscal year of adoption. This ASU is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. This ASU eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditors that have adopted ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which we adopted on January 1, 2020. This ASU also enhances the disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancing and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. In addition, the ASU amends the guidance on vintage disclosures to require entities to disclose current period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases within the scope of ASC 326-20. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption of the ASU would be applied prospectively. Early adoption is also permitted, including adoption in an interim period. This ASU is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. On August 16, 2022, the IRA was enacted into law and is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022. The IRA includes multiple incentives to promote clean energy, electric vehicles, battery and energy storage manufacture or purchase, in addition to a new corporate alternative minimum tax of 15 % on adjusted financial statement income of corporations with profits greater than $ 1 billion. These measures may materially affect our consolidated financial statements, and we will continue to evaluate the applicability and effect of the IRA as more guidance is issued. 66 Recently adopted accounting pronouncements In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-06, Deferral of the Sunset Date of Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848). Topic 848 provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to transactions affected by reference rate (e.g., LIBOR) reform if certain criteria are met, for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting. The ASU deferred the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. The ASU is effective as of December 21, 2022 through December 31, 2024. We continue to evaluate transactions or contract modifications occurring as a result of reference rate reform and determine whether to apply the optional guidance on an ongoing basis. We adopted ASU 2022-06 during 2022. The ASU has not and is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832). This ASU requires business entities to disclose information about government assistance they receive if the transactions were accounted for by analogy to either a grant or a contribution accounting model. The disclosure requirements include the nature of the transaction and the related accounting policy used, the line items on the balance sheets and statements of operations that are affected and the amounts applicable to each financial statement line item and the significant terms and conditions of the transactions. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021. The disclosure requirements can be applied either retrospectively or prospectively to all transactions in the scope of the amendments that are reflected in the financial statements at the date of initial application and new transactions that are entered into after the date of initial application. We adopted the ASU prospectively on January 1, 2022. Adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. ASU 2020-06 In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity. The ASU simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by removing certain separation models in ASC 470-20, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options, for convertible instruments. The ASU updates the guidance on certain embedded conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital, such that those features are no longer required to be separated from the host contract. The convertible debt instruments will be accounted for as a single liability measured at amortized cost. This will also result in the interest expense recognized for convertible debt instruments to be typically closer to the coupon interest rate when applying the guidance in Topic 835, Interest. Further, the ASU made amendments to the EPS guidance in Topic 260 for convertible debt instruments, the most significant impact of which is requiring the use of the if-converted method for diluted EPS calculation, and no longer allowing the net share settlement method. The ASU also made revisions to Topic 815-40, which provides guidance on how an entity must determine whether a contract qualifies for a scope exception from derivative accounting. The amendments to Topic 815-40 change the scope of contracts that are recognized as assets or liabilities. On January 1, 2021, we adopted the ASU using the modified retrospective method. We recognized a cumulative effect of initially applying the ASU as an adjustment to the January 1, 2021 opening balance of accumulated deficit. Due to the recombination of the equity conversion component of our convertible debt remaining outstanding, additional paid in capital and convertible senior notes (mezzanine equity) were reduced. The removal of the remaining debt discounts recorded for this previous separation had the effect of increasing our net debt balance and the reduction of property, plant and equipment was related to previously capitalized interest. The prior period consolidated financial statements have not been retrospectively adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. Accordingly, the cumulative effect of the changes made on our January 1, 2021 consolidated balance sheet for the adoption of the ASU was as follows (in millions): Balances at December 31, 2020 Adjustments from Adoption of ASU 2020-06 Balances at January 1, 2021 Assets Property, plant and equipment, net $ 12,747 $ ( 45 ) $ 12,702 Liabilities Current portion of debt and finance leases 2,132 50 2,182 Debt and finance leases, net of current portion 9,556 219 9,775 Mezzanine equity Convertible senior notes 51 ( 51 ) — Equity Additional paid-in capital 27,260 ( 474 ) 26,786 Accumulated deficit ( 5,399 ) 211 ( 5,188 ) 67 Note 3 – Digital Assets, Net During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we purchased and/or received an immaterial amount and $ 1.50 billion, respectively, of digital assets. As of December 31, 2022 , we have converted approximately 75 % of our purchases into fiat currency. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 , we recorded $ 204 million and $ 101 million of impairment losses on such digital assets, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 , we realized gains of $ 64 million and $ 128 million, respectively, in connection with converting our holdings of digital assets into fiat currency. The gains are presented net of impairment losses in Restructuring and other in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying value of our digital assets held was $ 184 million and $ 1.26 billion , which reflects cumulative impairments of $ 204 million and $ 101 million, each period, respectively. The fair market value of such digital assets held as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 191 million and $ 1.99 billion, respectively. Note 4 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill decreased $ 6 million within the automotive segment from $ 200 million as of December 31, 2021 to $ 194 million as of December 31, 2022. There were no accumulated impairment losses as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. The net carrying value of our intangible assets decreased from $ 257 million as of December 31, 2021 to $ 215 million as of December 31, 2022 mainly from amortization. Note 5 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments ASC 820 states that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The three-tiered fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes which inputs should be used in measuring fair value, is comprised of: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level II) inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and (Level III) unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data. The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available in determining fair value. Our assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows (in millions): December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Fair Value Level I Level II Level III Fair Value Level I Level II Level III Money market funds $ 2,188 $ 2,188 $ — $ — $ 9,548 $ 9,548 $ — $ — U.S. government securities 894 — 894 — — — — — Corporate debt securities 885 — 885 — 131 — 131 — Certificates of deposit and time deposits 4,253 — 4,253 — — — — — Interest rate swap liabilities — — — — 31 — 31 — Total $ 8,220 $ 2,188 $ 6,032 $ — $ 9,710 $ 9,548 $ 162 $ — All of our money market funds were classified within Level I of the fair value hierarchy because they were valued using quoted prices in active markets. Our U.S. government securities, certificates of deposit, time deposits and corporate debt securities are classified within Level II of the fair value hierarchy and the market approach was used to determine fair value of these investments. Our interest rate swaps were classified within Level II of the fair value hierarchy because they were valued using alternative pricing sources or models that utilized market observable inputs, including current and forward interest rates. 68 Our cash, cash equivalents and investments classified by security type as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 consisted of the following (in millions): December 31, 2022 Adjusted Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Cash and Cash Equivalents Short-Term Investments Cash $ 13,965 $ — $ — $ 13,965 $ 13,965 $ — Money market funds 2,188 — — 2,188 2,188 — U.S. government securities 897 — ( 3 ) 894 — 894 Corporate debt securities 907 — ( 22 ) 885 — 885 Certificates of deposit and time deposits 4,252 1 — 4,253 100 4,153 Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments $ 22,209 $ 1 $ ( 25 ) $ 22,185 $ 16,253 $ 5,932 December 31, 2021 Adjusted Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Cash and Cash Equivalents Short-Term Investments Cash $ 8,028 $ — $ — $ 8,028 $ 8,028 $ — Money market funds 9,548 — — 9,548 9,548 — Corporate debt securities 132 — ( 1 ) 131 — 131 Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments $ 17,708 $ — $ ( 1 ) $ 17,707 $ 17,576 $ 131 We record gross realized gains, losses and credit losses as a component of Other (expense) income, net in the consolidated statements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we did not recognize any material gross realized gains, losses or credit losses. The ending allowance balances for credit losses were immaterial as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. We have determined that the gross unrealized losses on our investments as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were temporary in nature. The following table summarizes the fair value of our investments by stated contractual maturities as of December 31, 2022 (in millions): Due in 1 year or less $ 5,135 Due in 1 year through 5 years 636 Due in 5 years through 10 years 161 Total $ 5,932 Disclosure of Fair Values Our financial instruments that are not re-measured at fair value include accounts receivable, financing receivables, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, customer deposits and debt. The carrying values of these financial instruments approximate their fair values, other than our 2.375 % Convertible Senior Notes due in 2022 (“2022 Notes”) and 2.00 % Convertible Senior Notes due in 2024 (“2024 Notes”) (collectively referred to as “Convertible Senior Notes” below). We estimate the fair value of the Convertible Senior Notes using commonly accepted valuation methodologies and market-based risk measurements that are indirectly observable, such as credit risk (Level II). The following table presents the estimated fair values and the carrying values (in millions): December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Convertible Senior Notes (1) $ 37 $ 223 $ 119 $ 2,016 (1) The 2022 Notes were fully settled in the first quarter of 2022. 69 Note 6 – Inventory Our inventory consisted of the following (in millions): December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 Raw materials $ 6,137 $ 2,816 Work in process 2,385 1,089 Finished goods (1) 3,475 1,277 Service parts 842 575 Total $ 12,839 $ 5,757 (1) Finished goods inventory includes vehicles in transit to fulfill customer orders, new vehicles available for sale, used vehicles and energy products available for sale. For solar energy systems, we commence transferring component parts from inventory to construction in progress, a component of solar energy systems, once a lease or PPA contract with a customer has been executed and installation has been initiated. Additional costs incurred on the leased solar energy systems, including labor and overhead, are recorded within solar energy systems under construction. We write-down inventory for any excess or obsolete inventories or when we believe that the net realizable value of inventories is less than the carrying value. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 we recorded write-downs of $ 144 million, $ 106 million and $ 145 million, respectively, in Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Note 7 – Solar Energy Systems, Net Our solar energy systems, net, consisted of the following (in millions): December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 Solar energy systems in service $ 6,785 $ 6,809 Initial direct costs related to customer solar energy system lease acquisition costs 104 104 6,889 6,913 Less: accumulated depreciation and amortization (1) ( 1,418 ) ( 1,187 ) 5,471 5,726 Solar energy systems under construction 2 18 Solar energy systems pending interconnection 16 21 Solar energy systems, net (2) $ 5,489 $ 5,765 (1) Depreciation and amortization expense during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 235 million, $ 236 million and $ 232 million, respectively. (2) As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were $ 802 million and $ 1.02 billion, respectively, of gross solar energy systems under lease pass-through fund arrangements with accumulated depreciation of $ 148 million and $ 165 million, respectively. Note 8 – Property, Plant and Equipment, Net Our property, plant and equipment, net, consisted of the following (in millions): December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 Machinery, equipment, vehicles and office furniture $ 13,558 $ 9,953 Tooling 2,579 2,188 Leasehold improvements 2,366 1,826 Land and buildings 7,751 4,675 Computer equipment, hardware and software 2,072 1,414 Construction in progress 4,263 5,559 32,589 25,615 Less: Accumulated depreciation ( 9,041 ) ( 6,731 ) Total $ 23,548 $ 18,884 70 Construction in progress is primarily comprised of construction of Gigafactory Texas and Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg, and equipment and tooling related to the manufacturing of our products. Completed assets are transferred to their respective asset classes and depreciation begins when an asset is ready for its intended use. Interest on outstanding debt is capitalized during periods of significant capital asset construction and amortized over the useful lives of the related assets. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we capitalized interest of an immaterial amount, $ 53 million and $ 48 million, respectively. Depreciation expense during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 2.42 billion, $ 1.91 billion and $ 1.57 billion, respectively. Panasonic has partnered with us on Gigafactory Nevada with investments in the production equipment that it uses to manufacture and supply us with battery cells. Under our arrangement with Panasonic, we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment at negotiated prices. As the terms of the arrangement convey a finance lease under ASC 842, we account for their production equipment as leased assets when production commences. We account for each lease and any non-lease components associated with that lease as a single lease component for all asset classes, except production equipment classes embedded in supply agreements. This results in us recording the cost of their production equipment within Property, plant and equipment, net, on the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding liability recorded to debt and finance leases. Depreciation on Panasonic production equipment is computed using the units-of-production method whereby capitalized costs are amortized over the total estimated productive life of the respective assets. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had cumulatively capitalized gross costs of $ 2.01 billion and $ 1.98 billion , respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets in relation to the production equipment under our Panasonic arrangement. Note 9 – Accrued Liabilities and Other Our accrued liabilities and other current liabilities consisted of the following (in millions): December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 Accrued purchases (1) $ 2,747 $ 2,045 Taxes payable (2) 1,235 1,122 Payroll and related costs 1,026 906 Accrued warranty reserve, current portion 1,025 703 Sales return reserve, current portion 270 265 Operating lease liabilities, current portion 485 368 Other current liabilities 354 310 Total $ 7,142 $ 5,719 (1) Accrued purchases primarily reflects receipts of goods and services for which we had not yet been invoiced. As we are invoiced for these goods and services, this balance will reduce and accounts payable will increase. For the year ended December 31, 2022, accrued purchases increased as we continued construction and expansion of our facilities and operations. (2) Taxes payable includes value added tax, sales tax, property tax, use tax and income tax payables. Note 10 – Other Long-Term Liabilities Our other long-term liabilities consisted of the following (in millions): December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 Operating lease liabilities $ 2,164 $ 1,671 Accrued warranty reserve 2,480 1,398 Sales return reserve 51 133 Deferred tax liability 82 24 Other non-current liabilities 553 320 Total other long-term liabilities $ 5,330 $ 3,546 71 Note 11 – Debt The following is a summary of our debt and finance leases as of December 31, 2022 (in millions): Unpaid Unused Net Carrying Value Principal Committed Contractual Contractual Current Long-Term Balance Amount (1) Interest Rates Maturity Date Recourse debt: 2024 Notes $ — $ 37 $ 37 $ — 2.00 % May 2024 Credit Agreement — — — 2,266 Not applicable July 2023 Solar Bonds — 7 7 — 4.70 - 5.75 % March 2025 - January 2031 Total recourse debt — 44 44 2,266 Non-recourse debt: Automotive Asset-backed Notes 984 613 1,603 — 0.36 - 4.64 % December 2023 - September 2025 Solar Asset-backed Notes 4 13 17 — 4.80 % December 2026 Cash Equity Debt 28 359 397 — 5.25 - 5.81 % July 2033 - January 2035 Automotive Lease-backed Credit Facilities — — — 151 Not applicable September 2024 Total non-recourse debt 1,016 985 2,017 151 Total debt 1,016 1,029 $ 2,061 $ 2,417 Finance leases 486 568 Total debt and finance leases $ 1,502 $ 1,597 The following is a summary of our debt and finance leases as of December 31, 2021 (in millions): Unpaid Unused Net Carrying Value Principal Committed Contractual Contractual Current Long-Term Balance Amount (1) Interest Rates Maturity Date Recourse debt: 2022 Notes $ 29 $ — $ 29 $ — 2.375 % March 2022 2024 Notes 1 89 91 — 2.00 % May 2024 Credit Agreement — 1,250 1,250 920 3.25 % July 2023 Solar Bonds 0 7 7 — 4.00 - 5.75 % January 2022 - January 2031 Total recourse debt 30 1,346 1,377 920 Non-recourse debt: Automotive Asset-backed Notes 1,007 1,706 2,723 — 0.12 - 5.48 % September 2022 - September 2025 Solar Asset and Loan-backed Notes 27 800 844 — 2.87 - 7.74 % September 2024 - September 2049 Cash Equity Debt 24 388 422 — 5.25 - 5.81 % July 2033 - January 2035 Automotive Lease-backed Credit Facilities — — — 167 Not applicable September 2023 Other Loans — 14 14 21 5.10 % February 2033 Total non-recourse debt 1,058 2,908 4,003 188 Total debt 1,088 4,254 $ 5,380 $ 1,108 Finance leases 501 991 Total debt and finance leases $ 1,589 $ 5,245 (1) There are no restrictions on draw-down or use for general corporate purposes with respect to any available committed funds under our credit facilities, except certain specified conditions prior to draw-down, including pledging to our lenders sufficient amounts of qualified receivables, inventories, leased vehicles and our interests in those leases or various other assets and as may be described below. Recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to our general assets. Non-recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to only assets of our subsidiaries. The differences between the unpaid principal balances and the net carrying values are due to debt discounts or deferred financing costs. As of December 31, 2022, we were in material compliance with all financial debt covenants. 2022 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant Transactions During the first quarter of 2022, the remaining $ 29 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes was converted and settled in cash for their par amount, and 1.2 million shares of our common stock were issued for the applicable conversion premium, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. The note hedges we entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2022 Notes were automatically settled with the respective conversions of the 2022 Notes, resulting in the receipt of 1.2 million shares of our common stock during the same period, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2022, we fully settled the warrants entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2022 Notes, resulting in the issuance of 37.0 million shares of our common stock, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. 2024 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant Transactions In May 2019, we issued $ 1.84 billion in aggregate principal amount of our 2024 Notes in a public offering. The net proceeds from the issuance, after deducting transaction costs, were $ 1.82 billion. 72 As adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split, each $ 1,000 of principal of the 2024 Notes is now convertible into 48.4140 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $ 20.66 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Holders of the 2024 Notes may convert, at their option, on or after February 15, 2024. Further, holders of the 2024 Notes may convert, at their option, prior to February 15, 2024 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after September 30, 2019 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130 % of the conversion price on each trading day; (2) during the five -business day period after any five-consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the 2024 Notes for each trading day of such period is less than 98 % of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day, or (3) if specified corporate events occur. Upon conversion, the 2024 Notes will be settled in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election. If a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date, holders of the 2024 Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2024 Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100 % of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if specific corporate events occur prior to the maturity date, we would increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its 2024 Notes in connection with such an event in certain circumstances. Early conversion of notes which are scheduled to settle in the following quarter are classified as current in our consolidated balance sheets. In connection with the offering of the 2024 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we had the option to purchase 89.1 million shares of our common stock at a price of approximately $ 20.66 per share, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. The cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $ 476 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby the holders of the warrants had the option to purchase 89.1 million shares of our common stock at a price of approximately $ 40.50 per share, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. We received $ 174 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of the warrants were intended to effectively increase the overall conversion price from approximately $ 20.66 to approximately $ 40.50 per share. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and warrants were recorded in stockholders’ equity and were not accounted for as derivatives. The net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet. The closing price of our common stock exceeded 130% of the applicable conversion price on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of each quarter in 2022, causing the 2024 Notes to be convertible by their holders in the subsequent quarter. During the year ended December 31, 2022, $ 54 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes was converted and settled in cash for their par amount, and 2.4 million shares of our common stock were issued for the applicable conversion premium, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. The note hedges we entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes were automatically settled with the respective conversions of the 2024 Notes, resulting in the receipt of 2.4 million shares of our common stock during the same period, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split . As of December 31, 2022, the if-converted value of the notes exceeds the outstanding principal amount by $ 186 million. Credit Agreement In June 2015, we entered into a senior asset-based revolving credit agreement (as amended from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks. Borrowed funds bear interest, at our option, at an annual rate of (a) 1 % plus LIBOR or (b) the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50 %, (ii) the lenders’ “prime rate” or (iii) 1% plus LIBOR. The fee for undrawn amounts is 0.25 % per annum. The Credit Agreement is secured by certain of our accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Availability under the Credit Agreement is based on the value of such assets, as reduced by certain reserves. In January 2023, we entered into a 5 -year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “RCF Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks to replace the existing Credit Agreement, which was terminated. The RCF Credit Agreement contains two optional one-year extensions and has a total commitment of up to $ 5.00 billion, which could be increased up to $ 7.00 billion under certain circumstances. The underlying borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes. Borrowed funds accrue interest at a variable rate equal to: (i) for dollar-denominated loans, at our election, (a) Term SOFR (the forward-looking secured overnight financing rate) plus 0.10 %, or (b) an alternate base rate; (ii) for loans denominated in pounds sterling, SONIA (the sterling overnight index average reference rate); or (iii) for loans denominated in euros, an adjusted EURIBOR (euro interbank offered rate); in each case, plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin will be based on the rating assigned to our senior, unsecured long-term indebtedness (the “Credit Rating”) from time to time. The fee for undrawn amounts is variable based on the Credit Rating and is currently 0.15 % per annum. 73 Automotive Asset-backed Notes From time to time, we transfer receivables or beneficial interests related to certain leased vehicles into special purpose entities (“SPEs”) and issue Automotive Asset-backed Notes, backed by these automotive assets to investors. The SPEs are consolidated in the financial statements. The cash flows generated by these automotive assets are used to service the principal and interest payments on the Automotive Asset-backed Notes and satisfy the SPEs’ expenses, and any remaining cash is distributed to the owners of the SPEs. We recognize revenue earned from the associated customer lease contracts in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The SPEs’ assets and cash flows are not available to our other creditors, and the creditors of the SPEs, including the Automotive Asset-backed Note holders, have no recourse to our other assets. Solar Asset and Loan-backed Notes Our subsidiaries pooled and transferred qualifying solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts, our interests in certain financing funds or certain MyPower customer notes receivable into SPEs and issued Solar Asset and Loan-backed Notes backed by these solar assets, interests to investors or MyPower customer notes receivable . The SPEs are wholly owned by us and are consolidated in the financial statements. The cash flows generated by these solar assets and notes receivable, or distributed by the underlying financing funds to certain SPEs are used to service the principal and interest payments on the Solar Asset and Loan-backed Notes and satisfy the SPEs’ expenses, and any remaining cash is distributed to us. The SPEs’ assets and cash flows are not available to our other creditors, and the creditors of the SPEs, including the Solar Asset and Loan-backed Note holders, have no recourse to our other assets. We contracted with certain SPEs to provide operations & maintenance and administrative services for the solar energy systems. As of December 31, 2022, solar assets pledged as collateral for Solar Asset and Loan-backed Notes had a carrying value of $ 69 million and are included within Solar energy systems, net, on the consolidated balance sheet. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we early repaid $ 819 million in aggregate principal of the Solar Asset and Loan-backed Notes and recorded an extinguishment of debt charge of $ 24 million related to the early repayments in Interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations. Cash Equity Debt In connection with the cash equity financing deals closed in 2016, our subsidiaries issued $ 502 million in aggregate principal amount of debt that bears interest at fixed rates. This debt is secured by, among other things, our interests in certain financing funds and is non-recourse to our other assets. Automotive Lease-backed Credit Facilities Our subsidiaries have entered into various credit agreements for borrowings secured by our interests in certain vehicle leases. These facilities are non-recourse to our other assets. Pledged Assets As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had pledged or restricted $ 2.02 billion and $ 5.25 billion of our assets (consisting principally of restricted cash, receivables, inventory, solar energy systems, operating lease vehicles, property and equipment and equity interests in certain SPEs) as collateral for our outstanding debt. Schedule of Principal Maturities of Debt The future scheduled principal maturities of debt as of December 31, 2022 were as follows (in millions): Recourse debt Non-recourse debt Total 2023 $ 0 $ 1,020 $ 1,020 2024 37 648 685 2025 4 35 39 2026 0 35 35 2027 — 25 25 Thereafter 3 254 257 Total $ 44 $ 2,017 $ 2,061 Note 12 – Leases We have entered into various operating and finance lease agreements for certain of our offices, manufacturing and warehouse facilities, retail and service locations, equipment, vehicles, and solar energy systems, worldwide. We determine if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at inception and record the leases in our financial statements upon lease commencement, which is the date when the underlying asset is made available for use by the lessor. 74 We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and have elected to utilize the practical expedient to account for lease and non-lease components together as a single combined lease component, from both a lessee and lessor perspective with the exception of direct sales-type leases and production equipment classes embedded in supply agreements. From a lessor perspective, the timing and pattern of transfer are the same for the non-lease components and associated lease component and, the lease component, if accounted for separately, would be classified as an operating lease. We have elected not to present short-term leases on the consolidated balance sheet as these leases have a lease term of 12 months or less at lease inception and do not contain purchase options or renewal terms that we are reasonably certain to exercise. All other lease assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. Because most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate of return, we used our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our leases, where we are the lessee, often include options to extend the lease term for up to 10 years . Some of our leases also include options to terminate the lease prior to the end of the agreed upon lease term. For purposes of calculating lease liabilities, lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as cost of revenues or operating expenses depending on the nature of the leased asset. Certain operating leases provide for annual increases to lease payments based on an index or rate. We calculate the present value of future lease payments based on the index or rate at the lease commencement date for new leases. Differences between the calculated lease payment and actual payment are expensed as incurred. Amortization of finance lease assets is recognized over the lease term as cost of revenues or operating expenses depending on the nature of the leased asset. Interest expense on finance lease liabilities is recognized over the lease term within Interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The balances for the operating and finance leases where we are the lessee are presented as follows (in millions) within our consolidated balance sheets: December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Operating leases: Operating lease right-of-use assets $ 2,563 $ 2,016 Accrued liabilities and other $ 485 $ 368 Other long-term liabilities 2,164 1,671 Total operating lease liabilities $ 2,649 $ 2,039 Finance leases: Solar energy systems, net $ 25 $ 27 Property, plant and equipment, net 1,094 1,536 Total finance lease assets $ 1,119 $ 1,563 Current portion of long-term debt and finance leases $ 486 $ 501 Long-term debt and finance leases, net of current portion 568 991 Total finance lease liabilities $ 1,054 $ 1,492 The components of lease expense are as follows (in millions) within our consolidated statements of operations: Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Operating lease expense: Operating lease expense (1) $ 798 $ 627 $ 451 Finance lease expense: Amortization of leased assets $ 493 $ 415 $ 348 Interest on lease liabilities 72 89 100 Total finance lease expense $ 565 $ 504 $ 448 Total lease expense $ 1,363 $ 1,131 $ 899 (1) Includes short-term leases and variable lease costs, which are immaterial. 75 Other information related to leases where we are the lessee is as follows: December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Weighted-average remaining lease term: Operating leases 6.4 years 6.5 years Finance leases 3.1 years 4.2 years Weighted-average discount rate: Operating leases 5.3 % 5.0 % Finance leases 5.7 % 5.8 % Supplemental cash flow information related to leases where we are the lessee is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities: Operating cash outflows from operating leases $ 754 $ 616 $ 456 Operating cash outflows from finance leases (interest payments) $ 75 $ 89 $ 100 Financing cash outflows from finance leases $ 502 $ 439 $ 338 Leased assets obtained in exchange for finance lease liabilities $ 58 $ 486 $ 188 Leased assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities $ 1,059 $ 818 $ 553 As of December 31, 2022, the maturities of our operating and finance lease liabilities (excluding short-term leases) are as follows (in millions): Operating Finance Leases Leases 2023 $ 610 $ 534 2024 558 387 2025 490 122 2026 383 52 2027 300 31 Thereafter 805 4 Total minimum lease payments 3,146 1,130 Less: Interest 497 76 Present value of lease obligations 2,649 1,054 Less: Current portion 485 486 Long-term portion of lease obligations $ 2,164 $ 568 As of December 31, 2022, we have excluded from the table above additional operating leases that have not yet commenced with aggregate rent payments of $ 901 million. These operating leases will commence between fiscal year 2023 and 2024 with lease terms of 2 years to 15 years. 76 Operating Lease and Sales-type Lease Receivables We are the lessor of certain vehicle and solar energy system arrangements as described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . As of December 31, 2022, maturities of our operating lease and sales-type lease receivables from customers for each of the next five years and thereafter were as follows (in millions): Operating Sales-type Leases Leases 2023 $ 1,212 $ 202 2024 900 208 2025 463 192 2026 215 174 2027 194 49 Thereafter 1,697 12 Gross lease receivables $ 4,681 $ 837 The above table does not include vehicle sales to customers or leasing partners with a resale value guarantee as the cash payments were received upfront. For our solar PPA arrangements, customers are charged solely based on actual power produced by the installed solar energy system at a predefined rate per kilowatt-hour of power produced. The future payments from such arrangements are not included in the above table as they are a function of the power generated by the related solar energy systems in the future. Net Investment in Sales-type Leases Net investment in sales-type leases, which is the sum of the present value of the future contractual lease payments, is presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. Lease receivables relating to sales-type leases are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as follows (in millions): December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Gross lease receivables $ 837 $ 427 Unearned interest income ( 95 ) ( 50 ) Allowance for expected credit losses ( 4 ) ( 1 ) Net investment in sales-type leases $ 738 $ 376 Reported as: Prepaid expenses and other current assets $ 164 $ 73 Other non-current assets 574 303 Net investment in sales-type leases $ 738 $ 376 Lease Pass-Through Financing Obligation As of December 31, 2022 , we have six transactions referred to as “lease pass-through fund arrangements.” Under these arrangements, our wholly owned subsidiaries finance the cost of solar energy systems with investors through arrangements contractually structured as master leases for an initial term ranging between 10 and 25 years . These solar energy systems are subject to lease or PPAs with customers with an initial term not exceeding 25 years . Under a lease pass-through fund arrangement, the investor makes a large upfront payment to the lessor, which is one of our subsidiaries, and in some cases, subsequent periodic payments. As of December 31, 2022, the future minimum master lease payments to be received from investors, for each of the next five years and thereafter, were as follows (in millions): 2023 $ 26 2024 18 2025 27 2026 28 2027 29 Thereafter 366 Total $ 494 77 Note 13 – Equity Incentive Plans In June 2019, we adopted the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”). The 2019 Plan provides for the grant of stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, performance units and performance shares to our employees, directors and consultants. Stock options granted under the 2019 Plan may be either incentive stock options or nonstatutory stock options. Incentive stock options may only be granted to our employees. Nonstatutory stock options may be granted to our employees, directors and consultants. Generally, our stock options and RSUs vest over four years and our stock options are exercisable over a maximum period of 10 years from their grant dates. Vesting typically terminates when the employment or consulting relationship ends. As of December 31, 2022, 148.0 million shares were reserved and available for issuance under the 2019 Plan, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. The following table summarizes our stock option and RSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2022: Stock Options RSUs Weighted- Weighted- Weighted- Average Aggregate Average Number of Average Remaining Intrinsic Number Grant Options Exercise Contractual Value of RSUs Date Fair (in thousands) Price Life (years) (in billions) (in thousands) Value Beginning of period (1) 357,120 $ 28.15 34,312 $ 88.23 Granted 4,120 $ 226.53 8,714 $ 239.85 Exercised or released ( 7,971 ) $ 27.96 ( 17,702 ) $ 61.74 Cancelled ( 9,705 ) $ 24.25 ( 3,991 ) $ 140.68 End of period 343,564 $ 30.65 5.19 $ 32.79 21,333 $ 162.32 Vested and expected to vest, December 31, 2022 343,105 $ 30.61 5.19 $ 32.75 21,323 $ 162.33 Exercisable and vested, December 31, 2022 (2) 304,862 $ 25.68 5.08 $ 29.93 (1) Prior period results have been adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. See Note 1, Overview , for details. (2) Tranche 12 of the 2018 CEO Performance Award, which represents 25.3 million stock options, was achieved in the fourth quarter of 2022 and will vest upon expected certification following the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 239.85 , $ 261.33 and $ 100.17 , respectively, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. The aggregate release date fair value of RSUs in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 4.32 billion, $ 5.70 billion and $ 3.25 billion, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $ 1.90 billion, $ 26.88 billion and $ 1.55 billion, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our CEO exercised all of the remaining vested options from the 2012 CEO Performance Award, which amounted to an intrinsic value of $ 23.45 billion. ESPP Our employees are eligible to purchase our common stock through payroll deductions of up to 15 % of their eligible compensation, subject to any plan limitations. The purchase price would be 85 % of the lower of the fair market value on the first and last trading days of each six-month offering period. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, under the ESPP we issued 1.4 million, 1.5 million and 5.5 million shares, respectively, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. As of December 31, 2022, there were 99.9 million shares available for issuance under the ESPP, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. 78 Fair Value Assumptions We use the fair value method in recognizing stock-based compensation expense. Under the fair value method, we estimate the fair value of each stock option award with service or service and performance conditions and the ESPP on the grant date generally using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model for stock options are as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Risk-free interest rate 3.11 % 0.66 % 0.26 % Expected term (in years) 4.1 4.3 3.9 Expected volatility 63 % 59 % 69 % Dividend yield 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % Grant date fair value per share (1) $ 114.51 $ 128.02 $ 72.05 (1) Prior period results have been adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. See Note 1, Overview , for details. The fair value of RSUs with service or service and performance conditions is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximating each grant’s expected life. We use our historical data in estimating the expected term of our employee grants. The expected volatility is based on the average of the implied volatility of publicly traded options for our common stock and the historical volatility of our common stock. 2018 CEO Performance Award In March 2018, our stockholders approved the Board of Directors’ grant of 304.0 million stock option awards, as adjusted to give effect to the 2020 Stock Split and the 2022 Stock Split, to our CEO (the “2018 CEO Performance Award”). The 2018 CEO Performance Award consists of 12 vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both operational milestones (performance conditions) and market conditions, assuming continued employment either as the CEO or as both Executive Chairman and Chief Product Officer and service through each vesting date. Each of the 12 vesting tranches of the 2018 CEO Performance Award will vest upon certification by the Board of Directors that both (i) the market capitalization milestone for such tranche, which began at $ 100.0 billion for the first tranche and increases by increments of $ 50.0 billion thereafter (based on both a six calendar month trailing average and a 30 calendar day trailing average, counting only trading days), has been achieved, and (ii) any one of the following eight operational milestones focused on total revenue or any one of the eight operational milestones focused on Adjusted EBITDA have been achieved for the four consecutive fiscal quarters on an annualized basis and subsequently reported by us in our consolidated financial statements filed with our Forms 10-Q and/or 10-K. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation. Upon vesting and exercise, including the payment of the exercise price of $ 23.34 per share as adjusted to give effect to the 2020 Stock Split and the 2022 Stock Split, our CEO must hold shares that he acquires for five years post-exercise, other than a cashless exercise where shares are simultaneously sold to pay for the exercise price and any required tax withholding. The achievement status of the operational milestones as of December 31, 2022 is provided below. Although an operational milestone is deemed achieved in the last quarter of the relevant annualized period, it may be certified only after the financial statements supporting its achievement have been filed with our Forms 10-Q and/or 10-K. Total Annualized Revenue Annualized Adjusted EBITDA Milestone (in billions) Achievement Status Milestone (in billions) Achievement Status $ 20.0 Achieved $ 1.5 Achieved $ 35.0 Achieved $ 3.0 Achieved $ 55.0 Achieved $ 4.5 Achieved $ 75.0 Achieved (1) $ 6.0 Achieved $ 100.0 - $ 8.0 Achieved $ 125.0 - $ 10.0 Achieved $ 150.0 - $ 12.0 Achieved $ 175.0 - $ 14.0 Achieved (1) Achieved in the fourth quarter of 2022 and expected to be certified following the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 79 Stock-based compensation under the 2018 CEO Performance Award represents a non-cash expense and is recorded as a Selling, general, and administrative operating expense in our consolidated statements of operations. In each quarter since the grant of the 2018 CEO Performance Award, we have recognized expense, generally on a pro-rated basis, for only the number of tranches (up to the maximum of 12 tranches) that corresponds to the number of operational milestones that have been achieved or have been determined probable of being achieved in the future, in accordance with the following principles. On the grant date, a Monte Carlo simulation was used to determine for each tranche (i) a fixed amount of expense for such tranche and (ii) the future time when the market capitalization milestone for such tranche was expected to be achieved, or its “expected market capitalization milestone achievement time.” Separately, based on a subjective assessment of our future financial performance, each quarter we determine whether it is probable that we will achieve each operational milestone that has not previously been achieved or deemed probable of achievement and if so, the future time when we expect to achieve that operational milestone, or its “expected operational milestone achievement time.” During the first quarter of 2022, three operational milestones were achieved and consequently, we recognized an aggregate catch-up expense of $ 11 million. As of December 31, 2022 , all remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation expense under the 2018 CEO Performance Award has been recognized. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded stock-based compensation expense of $ 66 million, $ 910 million and $ 838 million, respectively, related to the 2018 CEO Performance Award. Other Performance-Based Grants 2021 Performance-Based Stock Option & RSU Awards During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors granted to certain employees performance-based RSUs and stock options to purchase an aggregate 2.2 million shares of our common stock, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. We begin recording stock-based compensation expense when the performance milestones become probable of achievement. Following achievement, vesting occurs over a two-year period with continued employment. As of December 31, 2022, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $ 204 million, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.2 years. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded $ 159 million of stock-based compensation expense related to this grant, net of forfeitures. Summary Stock-Based Compensation Information The following table summarizes our stock-based compensation expense by line item in the consolidated statements of operations (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Cost of revenues $ 594 $ 421 $ 281 Research and development 536 448 346 Selling, general and administrative 430 1,252 1,107 Total $ 1,560 $ 2,121 $ 1,734 Our income tax benefits recognized from stock-based compensation arrangements in each of the periods presented were immaterial due to cumulative losses and valuation allowances. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, stock-based compensation expense capitalized to our consolidated balance sheets was $ 245 million, $ 182 million and $ 89 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, we had $ 3.94 billion of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to non-performance awards, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.26 years. 80 Note 14 – Income Taxes A provision for income taxes of $ 1.13 billion, $ 699 million and $ 292 million has been recognized for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, related primarily to our subsidiaries located outside of the U.S. Our income before provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Domestic $ 5,524 $ ( 130 ) $ ( 198 ) Noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest 31 125 141 Foreign 8,164 6,348 1,211 Income before income taxes $ 13,719 $ 6,343 $ 1,154 The components of the provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 consisted of the following (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Current: Federal $ — $ — $ — State 62 9 4 Foreign 1,266 839 248 Total current 1,328 848 252 Deferred: Federal 26 — — State 1 — — Foreign ( 223 ) ( 149 ) 40 Total deferred ( 196 ) ( 149 ) 40 Total provision for income taxes $ 1,132 $ 699 $ 292 Deferred tax assets (liabilities) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 consisted of the following (in millions): December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 Deferred tax assets: Net operating loss carry-forwards $ 4,486 $ 7,607 Research and development credits 1,184 923 Other tax credits and attributes 217 335 Deferred revenue 751 546 Inventory and warranty reserves 819 377 Stock-based compensation 185 115 Operating lease right-of-use liabilities 554 430 Capitalized research and development costs 693 — Deferred GILTI tax assets 466 556 Accruals and others 178 191 Total deferred tax assets 9,533 11,080 Valuation allowance ( 7,349 ) ( 9,074 ) Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance 2,184 2,006 Deferred tax liabilities: Depreciation and amortization ( 1,178 ) ( 1,279 ) Investment in certain financing funds ( 238 ) ( 209 ) Operating lease right-of-use assets ( 506 ) ( 391 ) Deferred revenue — ( 49 ) Other ( 15 ) ( 13 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ( 1,937 ) ( 1,941 ) Deferred tax assets (liabilities), net of valuation allowance $ 247 $ 65 81 As of December 31, 2022 , we recorded a valuation allowance of $ 7.35 billion for the portion of the deferred tax asset that we do not expect to be realized. The valuation allowance on our net deferred taxes decreased by $ 1.73 billion in the year ended December 31, 2022, and increased by $ 6.14 billion and $ 974 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 , respectively. The changes in valuation allowance are primarily due to changes in U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities incurred in the respective year. The decrease in the year ended December 31, 2022 included utilization of $ 13.57 billion net operating loss carry forwards to offset our 2022 U.S. taxable income. We have $ 532 million of deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions, which management believes are more-likely-than-not to be realized given the expectation of future earnings in these jurisdictions. We did not have any material releases of valuation allowance for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. We continue to monitor the realizability of the U.S. deferred tax assets taking into account multiple factors. In completing this assessment, we considered both objective and subjective factors. These factors included, but were not limited to, a history of losses in prior years, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, future reversal of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. After evaluating all available evidence, we intend to continue maintaining a full valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. Given the improvement in our operating results and depending on the amount of stock-based compensation tax deductions available in the future, we may release the valuation allowance associated with the U.S. deferred tax assets in the next few years. Release of all, or a portion, of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. The reconciliation of taxes at the federal statutory rate to our provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Tax at statutory federal rate $ 2,881 $ 1,332 $ 242 State tax, net of federal benefit 51 6 4 Nondeductible executive compensations 14 201 184 Other nondeductible expenses 89 67 52 Excess tax benefits related to stock based compensation ( 745 ) ( 7,123 ) ( 666 ) Foreign income rate differential ( 923 ) ( 668 ) 33 U.S. tax credits ( 276 ) ( 328 ) ( 181 ) Noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests adjustment 42 11 5 GILTI inclusion 1,279 1,008 133 Unrecognized tax benefits 252 28 1 Change in valuation allowance ( 1,532 ) 6,165 485 Provision for income taxes $ 1,132 $ 699 $ 292 As of December 31, 2022 , we had $ 18.0 billion of federal and $ 14.0 billion of state net operating loss carry-forwards available to offset future taxable income, some of which, if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2023 for federal and state purposes. A portion of these losses were generated by our acquisition of SolarCity Corporation (“SolarCity”) and some of the other companies we acquired, and therefore are subject to change of control provisions, which limit the amount of acquired tax attributes that can be utilized in a given tax year. We do not expect the change of control limitations or expiration dates to significantly impact our ability to utilize these attributes. As of December 31, 2022 , we had research and development tax credits of $ 969 million and $ 734 million for federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. If not utilized, the federal research and development tax credits will expire in various amounts beginning in 2024 . However, the state of California research and development tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely. In addition, we have other general business tax credits of $ 197 million for federal income tax purposes, which will not begin to significantly expire until 2033 . Federal and state laws can impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards in the event of an “ownership change,” as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. We have determined that no significant limitation would be placed on the utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards due to prior ownership changes. The local government of Shanghai granted a beneficial corporate income tax rate of 15 % to certain eligible enterprises, compared to the 25 % statutory corporate income tax rate in China. Our Gigafactory Shanghai subsidiary was granted this beneficial income tax rate of 15 % for 2019 through 2023. 82 As of December 31, 2022 , we intend to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings and cash unless such repatriation results in no or minimal tax costs. We have recorded the taxes associated with the earnings we intend to repatriate in the future. For the earnings we intend to indefinitely reinvest, no deferred tax liabilities for foreign withholding or other taxes have been recorded. The estimated amount of such unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with the indefinitely reinvested earnings is approximately $ 168 million. Uncertain Tax Positions The changes to our gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows (in millions): December 31, 2019 $ 273 Increases in balances related to prior year tax positions 66 Increases in balances related to current year tax positions 41 December 31, 2020 380 Increases in balances related to prior year tax positions 117 Decreases in balances related to prior year tax positions ( 90 ) Increases in balances related to current year tax positions 124 December 31, 2021 531 Increases in balances related to prior year tax positions 136 Decreases in balances related to prior year tax positions ( 12 ) Increases in balances related to current year tax positions 222 Decreases in balances related to expiration of the statute of limitations ( 7 ) December 31, 2022 $ 870 As of December 31, 2022 , accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense and amounted to $ 31 million. Unrecognized tax benefits of $ 572 million, if recognized, would not affect our effective tax rate since the tax benefits would increase a deferred tax asset that is currently fully offset by a valuation allowance. We file income tax returns in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for the years 2015 to 2018 . Additional tax years within the periods 2004 to 2014 and 2019 to 2021 remain subject to examination for federal income tax purposes. All net operating losses and tax credits generated to date are subject to adjustment for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. Our returns for 2004 and subsequent tax years remain subject to examination in U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions. Given the uncertainty in timing and outcome of our tax examinations, an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible change in gross unrecognized tax benefits within twelve months cannot be made at this time. Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies Operating Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York We have an operating lease through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to further develop the facility. Under this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $ 5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10-year period beginning April 30, 2018. On an annual basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each anniversary of such date, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation requirements, then we would be obligated to pay a $ 41 million “program payment” to the SUNY Foundation for each year that we fail to meet these requirements. Furthermore, if the arrangement is terminated due to a material breach by us, then additional amounts may become payable by us. In 2021, an amendment was executed to extend our overall agreement to spend or incur $ 5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31, 2029. On February 1, 2022, we reported to the State of New York that we had met and exceeded our annual requirements for jobs and investment in Buffalo and New York State. As of December 31, 2022, we are currently in excess of such targets relating to investments and personnel in the State of New York and Buffalo and do not currently expect any issues meeting our applicable obligations in the years beyond. However, if our expectations as to the costs and timelines of our investment and operations at Buffalo or our production ramp of the Solar Roof prove incorrect, we may incur additional expenses or be required to make substantial payments to the SUNY Foundation. 83 Operating Lease Arrangement in Shanghai, China We have an operating lease arrangement for an initial term of 50 years with the local government of Shanghai for land use rights where we have been constructing Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the terms of the arrangement, we are required to spend RMB 14.08 billion in capital expenditures by the end of 2023 and to generate RMB 2.23 billion of annual tax revenues starting at the end of 2023. If we are unwilling or unable to meet such target or obtain periodic project approvals, in accordance with the Chinese government’s standard terms for such arrangements, we would be required to revert the site to the local government and receive compensation for the remaining value of the land lease, buildings and fixtures. We expect to meet the capital expenditure and tax revenue requirements based on our current level of spend and sales. Legal Proceedings Litigation Relating to the SolarCity Acquisition Between September 1, 2016 and October 5, 2016, seven lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery by purported stockholders of Tesla challenging our acquisition of SolarCity. Following consolidation, the lawsuit names as defendants the members of Tesla’s board of directors as then constituted and alleges, among other things, that board members breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the acquisition. The complaint asserts both derivative claims and direct claims on behalf of a purported class and seeks, among other relief, unspecified monetary damages, attorneys’ fees and costs. On January 22, 2020, all of the director defendants except Elon Musk reached a settlement to resolve the lawsuit against them for an amount to be paid entirely under the applicable insurance policy. The settlement, which does not involve an admission of any wrongdoing by any party, was approved by the Court on August 17, 2020. Tesla received payment of approximately $ 43 million on September 16, 2020, which has been recognized in our consolidated statements of operations as a reduction to Selling, general and administrative operating expenses for costs previously incurred related to the acquisition of SolarCity. On February 4, 2020, the Court issued a ruling that denied plaintiffs’ previously-filed motion for summary judgment and granted in part and denied in part defendants’ previously-filed motion for summary judgment. The case was set for trial in March 2020 until it was postponed by the Court due to safety precautions concerning COVID-19. The trial was held from July 12 to July 23, 2021 and on August 16, 2021. On October 22, 2021, the Court approved the parties’ joint stipulation that (a) the class is decertified and the action shall continue exclusively as a derivative action under Court of Chancery Rule 23.1 and (b) the direct claims against Elon Musk are dismissed with prejudice. Following post-trial briefing, post-trial argument was held on January 18, 2022. On April 27, 2022, the Court entered judgment in favor of Mr. Musk on all counts. On May 26, 2022, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal. The parties have completed briefing and argument will be held before the Supreme Court of Delaware on March 29, 2023. These plaintiffs and others filed parallel actions in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on or about April 21, 2017. They include claims for violations of the federal securities laws and breach of fiduciary duties by Tesla’s board of directors. Those actions have been consolidated and stayed pending the above-referenced Chancery Court litigation. Litigation Relating to 2018 CEO Performance Award On June 4, 2018, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a putative class and derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Elon Musk and the members of Tesla’s board of directors as then constituted, alleging corporate waste, unjust enrichment and that such board members breached their fiduciary duties by approving the stock-based compensation plan awarded to Elon Musk in 2018. The complaint seeks, among other things, monetary damages and rescission or reformation of the stock-based compensation plan. On August 31, 2018, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint; plaintiff filed its opposition brief on November 1, 2018; and defendants filed a reply brief on December 13, 2018. The hearing on the motion to dismiss was held on May 9, 2019. On September 20, 2019, the Court granted the motion to dismiss as to the corporate waste claim but denied the motion as to the breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims. Defendants’ answer was filed on December 3, 2019. On January 25, 2021, the Court conditionally certified certain claims and a class of Tesla stockholders as a class action. On September 30, 2021, plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file a verified amended derivative complaint. On October 1, 2021, defendants Kimbal Musk and Steve Jurvetson moved for summary judgment as to the claims against them. Following the motion, plaintiff agreed to voluntarily dismiss the claims against Kimbal Musk and Steve Jurvetson. Plaintiff also moved for summary judgment on October 1, 2021. On October 27, 2021, the Court approved the parties’ joint stipulation that, among other things, (a) all claims against Kimbal Musk and Steve Jurvetson in the Complaint are dismissed with prejudice; (b) the class is decertified and the action shall continue exclusively as a derivative action under Court of Chancery Rule 23.1; and (c) the direct claims against the remaining defendants are dismissed with prejudice. On November 18, 2021, the remaining defendants (a) moved for partial summary judgment, (b) opposed plaintiff’s summary judgment motion and (c) opposed the plaintiff’s motion to amend his complaint. In January 2022, the case was assigned to a different judge. On February 24, 2022, the court (i) granted plaintiff’s motion to amend his complaint, and (ii) canceled oral argument on the summary judgment motions, stating that the court is “skeptical that this litigation can be resolved based on the undisputed facts” and the “case is going to trial,” but that the “parties may reassert their arguments made in support of summary judgment in their pre-trial and post-trial briefs.” Trial was held November 14-18, 2022. Post-trial briefing is underway and post-trial argument is scheduled for February 21, 2023. 84 Litigation Related to Directors’ Compensation On June 17, 2020, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla’s current and former directors regarding compensation awards granted to Tesla’s directors, other than Elon Musk, between 2017 and 2020. The suit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages and other relief. Defendants filed their answer on September 17, 2020. Trial is currently set for November 27, 2023, to December 1, 2023. Litigation Relating to Potential Going Private Transaction Between August 10, 2018 and September 6, 2018, nine purported stockholder class actions were filed against Tesla and Elon Musk in connection with Mr. Musk’s August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. All of the suits are now pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Although the complaints vary in certain respects, they each purport to assert claims for violations of federal securities laws related to Mr. Musk’s statement and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Tesla’s securities. Plaintiffs filed their consolidated complaint on January 16, 2019 and added as defendants the members of Tesla’s board of directors. The now-consolidated purported stockholder class action was stayed while the issue of selection of lead counsel was briefed and argued before the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit ruled regarding lead counsel. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on November 22, 2019. The hearing on the motion was held on March 6, 2020. On April 15, 2020, the Court denied defendants’ motion to dismiss. The parties stipulated to certification of a class of stockholders, which the court granted on November 25, 2020. On January 11, 2022, plaintiff filed a motion for partial summary judgment. On April 1, 2022, the Court granted in part plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment. The Company disagrees with the ruling and accordingly, on April 22, 2022, asked the Court for reconsideration or, in the alternative, certification to file an interlocutory appeal. On June 16, 2022, in response to Tesla’s motions, the Court denied certification to appeal and declined to reconsider its opinion but clarified its summary judgment ruling to make clear that it had not ruled that any misstatements it identified met the required materiality element under the securities statute. The issue of materiality and reliance will both be questions for the jury to decide at trial, which started on January 17, 2023. Between October 17, 2018 and March 8, 2021, seven derivative lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of Tesla’s board of directors, as constituted at relevant times, in relation to statements made and actions connected to a potential going private transaction, with certain of the lawsuits challenging additional Twitter posts by Mr. Musk, among other things. Five of those actions were consolidated, and all seven actions have been stayed pending resolution of the above-referenced consolidated purported stockholder class action. In addition to these cases, two derivative lawsuits were filed on October 25, 2018 and February 11, 2019 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of the Tesla board of directors as then constituted. Those cases have also been consolidated and stayed pending resolution of the above-referenced consolidated purported stockholder class action. On October 21, 2022, a lawsuit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery by a purported shareholder of Tesla alleging, among other things, that board members breached their fiduciary duties in connection with their oversight of the Company’s 2018 settlement with the SEC, as amended. Among other things, the plaintiff seeks reforms to the Company’s corporate governance and internal procedures, unspecified damages, and attorneys’ fees. The parties reached an agreement to stay the case until March 7, 2023. Unless otherwise stated, the individual defendants named in the stockholder proceedings described above and the Company with respect to the stockholder class action proceedings described above believe that the claims in such proceedings have no merit and intend to defend against them vigorously. We are unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these claims. On November 15, 2021, JPMorgan Chase Bank (“JP Morgan”) filed a lawsuit against Tesla in the Southern District of New York alleging breach of a stock warrant agreement that was entered into as part of a convertible notes offering in 2014. In 2018, JP Morgan informed Tesla that it had adjusted the strike price based upon Mr. Musk’s August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. Tesla disputed JP Morgan’s adjustment as a violation of the parties’ agreement. In 2021, Tesla delivered shares to JP Morgan per the agreement, which they duly accepted. JP Morgan now alleges that it is owed approximately $ 162 million as the value of additional shares that it claims should have been delivered as a result of the adjustment to the strike price in 2018. On January 24, 2022, Tesla filed multiple counterclaims as part of its answer to the underlying lawsuit, asserting among other points that JP Morgan should have terminated the stock warrant agreement in 2018 rather than make an adjustment to the strike price that it should have known would lead to a commercially unreasonable result. Tesla believes that the adjustments made by JP Morgan were neither proper nor commercially reasonable, as required under the stock warrant agreements. JP Morgan filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, which Tesla opposed, and that motion is currently pending before the Court. 85 Litigation and Investigations Relating to Alleged Discrimination and Harassment On October 4, 2021, in a case captioned Diaz v. Tesla , a jury in the Northern District of California returned a verdict of $ 136.9 million against Tesla on claims by a former contingent worker that he was subjected to race discrimination while assigned to work at Tesla’s Fremont Factory from 2015-2016. On November 16, 2021, Tesla filed a post-trial motion for relief that included a request for a new trial or reduction of the jury’s damages. The Court held a hearing on Tesla’s motion on January 19, 2022. On April 13, 2022, the Court granted Tesla’s motion in part, reducing the total damages to $ 15 million and conditionally denied the motion for a new trial subject to the plaintiff’s acceptance of the reduced award. On June 21, 2022, the plaintiff rejected the reduced award and, as a result, on June 27, 2022, the Court ordered a new trial on damages only, to commence on March 27, 2023. Tesla continues to believe that the facts and law do not justify the damages awarded and is assessing its next steps. On February 9, 2022, shortly after the Diaz jury verdict, the California Civil Rights Department (”CRD,” formerly “DFEH”) filed a civil complaint against Tesla in Alameda County, California Superior Court, alleging systemic race discrimination, hostile work environment and pay equity claims, among others. CRD’s amended complaint seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief. On September 22, 2022, Tesla filed a cross complaint against CRD, alleging that it violated the Administrative Procedures Act by failing to follow statutory pre-requisites prior to filing suit and that cross complaint was subject to a sustained demurrer. Tesla has until February 3, 2023 to amend its cross complaint. The case is now in discovery. Additionally, on June 1, 2022 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) issued a cause finding against Tesla that closely parallels the CRD’s allegations. Tesla is in the process of setting up a mandatory mediation with the EEOC. On June 16, 2022, two Tesla stockholders filed separate derivative actions in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla’s current and former directors. Both suits assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and violation of the federal securities laws in connection with alleged race and gender discrimination and sexual harassment. Among other things, plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages payable to Tesla, and attorneys’ fees. On July 22, 2022, the Court consolidated the two cases and on September 6, 2022, plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. On November 7, 2022, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the case. Plaintiffs filed a response of January 13, 2023, and the defendants’ reply is due February 17, 2023. Certain Investigations and Other Matters We receive requests for information from regulators and governmental authorities, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board, the SEC, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and various state, federal, and international agencies. We routinely cooperate with such regulatory and governmental requests, including subpoenas, formal and informal requests and other investigations and inquiries. For example, the SEC had issued subpoenas to Tesla in connection with Elon Musk’s prior statement that he was considering taking Tesla private. The take-private investigation was resolved and closed with a settlement entered into with the SEC in September 2018 and as further clarified in April 2019 in an amendment. The SEC also has periodically issued subpoenas to us seeking information on our governance processes around compliance with the SEC settlement, as amended. Separately, the company has received requests from the DOJ for documents related to Tesla’s Autopilot and FSD features. To our knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. We cannot predict the outcome or impact of any ongoing matters. Should the government decide to pursue an enforcement action, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation, prospects, cash flows and financial position. We are also subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that arise from the normal course of business activities. If an unfavorable ruling or development were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position and brand. 86 Letters of Credit As of December 31, 2022 , we had $ 318 million of unused letters of credit outstanding. Note 16 – Variable Interest Entity Arrangements We have entered into various arrangements with investors to facilitate the funding and monetization of our solar energy systems and vehicles. In particular, our wholly owned subsidiaries and fund investors have formed and contributed cash and assets into various financing funds and entered into related agreements. We have determined that the funds are VIEs and we are the primary beneficiary of these VIEs by reference to the power and benefits criterion under ASC 810. We have considered the provisions within the agreements, which grant us the power to manage and make decisions that affect the operation of these VIEs, including determining the solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts to be sold or contributed to these VIEs, redeploying solar energy systems and managing customer receivables. We consider that the rights granted to the fund investors under the agreements are more protective in nature rather than participating. As the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, we consolidate in the financial statements the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of these VIEs, and all intercompany balances and transactions between us and these VIEs are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Cash distributions of income and other receipts by a fund, net of agreed upon expenses, estimated expenses, tax benefits and detriments of income and loss and tax credits, are allocated to the fund investor and our subsidiary as specified in the agreements. Generally, our subsidiary has the option to acquire the fund investor’s interest in the fund for an amount based on the market value of the fund or the formula specified in the agreements. Upon the sale or liquidation of a fund, distributions would occur in the order and priority specified in the agreements. Pursuant to management services, maintenance and warranty arrangements, we have been contracted to provide services to the funds, such as operations and maintenance support, accounting, lease servicing and performance reporting. In some instances, we have guaranteed payments to the fund investors as specified in the agreements. A fund’s creditors have no recourse to our general credit or to that of other funds. Certain assets of the funds have been pledged as collateral for their obligations. The aggregate carrying values of the VIEs’ assets and liabilities, after elimination of any intercompany transactions and balances, in the consolidated balance sheets were as follows (in millions): December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 Assets Current assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 68 $ 87 Accounts receivable, net 22 24 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 274 152 Total current assets 364 263 Solar energy systems, net 4,060 4,515 Other non-current assets 404 276 Total assets $ 4,828 $ 5,054 Liabilities Current liabilities Accrued liabilities and other $ 69 $ 74 Deferred revenue 10 11 Current portion of debt and finance leases 1,013 1,031 Total current liabilities 1,092 1,116 Deferred revenue, net of current portion 149 161 Debt and finance leases, net of current portion 971 2,093 Other long-term liabilities 3 11 Total liabilities $ 2,215 $ 3,381 Note 17 – Related Party Transactions In February 2020, our CEO and a member of our Board of Directors purchased from us 195,555 and 18,750 shares, respectively, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split, of our common stock in a public offering at the public offering price for an aggregate $ 10 million and $ 1 million, respectively. 87 In June 2020, our CEO entered into an indemnification agreement with us for an interim term of 90 days. During the interim term, we resumed our annual evaluation of all available options for providing directors’ and officers’ indemnity coverage, which we had suspended during the height of shelter-in-place requirements related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of such process, we obtained a binding market quote for a directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy with an aggregate coverage limit of $ 100 million. Pursuant to the indemnification agreement, our CEO provided, from his personal funds, directors’ and officers’ indemnity coverage to us during the interim term in the event such coverage is not indemnifiable by us, up to a total of $ 100 million. In return, we paid our CEO a total of $ 3 million, which represents the market-based premium for the market quote described above as prorated for 90 days and further discounted by 50 %. Following the lapse of the 90-day period, we did not extend the term of the indemnification agreement with our CEO and instead bound a customary directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy with third-party carriers. In relation to our CEO’s exercise of stock options and sale of common stock from the 2012 CEO Performance Award, Tesla withheld the appropriate amount of taxes. However, given the significant amounts involved, our CEO entered into an indemnification agreement with us in November 2021 for additional taxes owed, if any. Tesla periodically does business with certain entities with which its CEO and directors are affiliated, such as SpaceX and Twitter, Inc., in accordance with our Related Person Transactions Policy. Such transactions have not had to date, and are not currently expected to have, a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Note 18 – Segment Reporting and Information about Geographic Areas We have two operating and reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage. The automotive segment includes the design, development, manufacturing, sales and leasing of electric vehicles as well as sales of automotive regulatory credits. Additionally, the automotive segment is also comprised of services and other, which includes non-warranty after-sales vehicle services and parts, paid Supercharging, sales of used vehicles, retail merchandise and vehicle insurance revenue. The energy generation and storage segment includes the design, manufacture, installation, sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products and related services and sales of solar energy systems incentives. Our CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset or liability information. The following table presents revenues and gross profit by reportable segment (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Automotive segment Revenues $ 77,553 $ 51,034 $ 29,542 Gross profit $ 20,565 $ 13,735 $ 6,612 Energy generation and storage segment Revenues $ 3,909 $ 2,789 $ 1,994 Gross profit $ 288 $ ( 129 ) $ 18 The following table presents revenues by geographic area based on the sales location of our products (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 United States $ 40,553 $ 23,973 $ 15,207 China 18,145 13,844 6,662 Other 22,764 16,006 9,667 Total $ 81,462 $ 53,823 $ 31,536 The following table presents long-lived assets by geographic area (in millions): December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 United States $ 21,667 $ 19,026 Germany 3,547 2,606 China 2,978 2,415 Other international 845 602 Total $ 29,037 $ 24,649 88 The following table presents inventory by reportable segment (in millions): December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 Automotive $ 10,996 $ 4,978 Energy generation and storage 1,843 779 Total $ 12,839 $ 5,757 Note 19 – Restructuring and Other During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 , we recorded $ 204 million and $ 101 million, respectively, of impairment losses on digital assets.

Additionally, we recorded other expenses of $ 36 million in the second quarter during the year ended December 31, 2022 . 89 ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were designed at a reasonable assurance level and were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. Our independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, as stated in their report which is included herein. Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

As of March 31, 2023, total transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than one year was $ 209 million. Of this amount, we expect to recognize $ 12 million in the next 12 months and the remaining over a period up to 25 years. We have been providing loans for financing our energy generation products in volume since fiscal year 2022. As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , we have recorded net financing receivables on the consolidated balance sheets, of which $ 29 million and $ 24 million, respectively, is recorded within Accounts receivable, net, for the current portion and $ 448 million and $ 387 million, respectively, is recorded within Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. Income Taxes There are transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , the aggregate balances of our gross unrecognized tax benefits were $ 926 million and $ 870 million, respectively, of which $ 578 million and $ 572 million, respectively, would not give rise to changes in our effective tax rate since these tax benefits would increase a deferred tax asset that is currently fully offset by a valuation allowance. We file income tax returns in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for the years 2015 to 2018 . Additional tax years within the periods 2004 to 2014 and 2019 to 2021 remain subject to examination for federal income tax purposes. All net operating losses and tax credits generated to date are subject to adjustment for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. Our returns for 2004 and subsequent tax years remain subject to examination in U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions. Given the uncertainty in timing and outcome of our tax examinations, an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible change in gross unrecognized tax benefits within twelve months cannot be made at this time. 10 Net Income per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders The following table presents the reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders to net income used in computing basic and diluted net income per share of common stock (in millions): Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 2,513 $ 3,318 Less: Buy-out of noncontrolling interest ( 5 ) 5 Net income used in computing basic net income per share of common stock 2,518 3,313 Less: Dilutive convertible debt 0 0 Net income used in computing diluted net income per share of common stock $ 2,518 $ 3,313 The following table presents the reconciliation of basic to diluted weighted average shares used in computing net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders, as adjusted to give effect to the three -for-one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend in August 2022 (the “2022 Stock Split”) (in millions): Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 Weighted average shares used in computing net income per share of common stock, basic 3,166 3,103 Add: Stock-based awards 289 313 Convertible senior notes 2 5 Warrants 11 51 Weighted average shares used in computing net income per share of common stock, diluted 3,468 3,472 The following table presents the potentially dilutive shares that were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders, because their effect was anti-dilutive, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split (in millions): Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 Stock-based awards 25 2 Restricted Cash Our total cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows, was as follows (in millions): March 31, December 31, March 31, December 31, 2023 2022 2022 2021 Cash and cash equivalents $ 16,048 $ 16,253 $ 17,505 $ 17,576 Restricted cash included in prepaid expenses and other current assets 486 294 297 345 Restricted cash included in other non-current assets 236 377 238 223 Total as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows $ 16,770 $ 16,924 $ 18,040 $ 18,144 11 Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Depending on the day of the week on which the end of a fiscal quarter falls, our accounts receivable balance may fluctuate as we are waiting for certain customer payments to clear through our banking institutions and receipts of payments from our financing partners, which can take up to approximately two weeks based on the contractual payment terms with such partners. Our accounts receivable balances associated with our sales of regulatory credits, which are typically transferred to other manufacturers during the last few days of the quarter, is dependent on contractual payment terms. Additionally, government rebates can take up to a year or more to be collected depending on the customary processing timelines of the specific jurisdictions issuing them. These various factors may have a significant impact on our accounts receivable balance from period to period. As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , we had $ 575 million and $ 753 million, respectively, of long-term government rebates receivable in Other non-current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Financing Receivables As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the majority of our financing receivables were at current status with only immaterial balances being past due. As of March 31, 2023, the majority of our financing receivables, excluding MyPower notes receivable, were originated in 2023 and 2022, and as of December 31, 2022, the majority of our financing receivables, excluding MyPower notes receivable, were originated in 2022. As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , the total outstanding balance of MyPower customer notes receivable, net of allowance for expected credit losses, was $ 276 million and $ 280 million, respectively, of which $ 6 million and $ 7 million were due in the next 12 months as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , the allowance for expected credit losses was $ 37 million. Concentration of Risk Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, investments, restricted cash, accounts receivable and other finance receivables. Our cash and investments balances are primarily comprised of deposits which are diversified among high credit quality financial institutions or invested in U.S. government securities. These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits. As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , no entity represented 10 % or more of our total receivables balance. Supply Risk We are dependent on our suppliers, including single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our products in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these components from these suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Operating Lease Vehicles The gross cost of operating lease vehicles as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $ 6.56 billion and $ 6.08 billion, respectively. Operating lease vehicles on the consolidated balance sheets are presented net of accumulated depreciation of $ 1.09 billion and $ 1.04 billion as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , respectively. Warranties Accrued warranty activity consisted of the following (in millions): Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 Accrued warranty—beginning of period $ 3,505 $ 2,101 Warranty costs incurred ( 280 ) ( 151 ) Net changes in liability for pre-existing warranties, including expirations and foreign exchange impact 208 15 Provision for warranty 532 322 Accrued warranty—end of period $ 3,965 $ 2,287 12 Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently adopted accounting pronouncements In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2021-08, Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (Topic 805). This ASU requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities (deferred revenue) from acquired contracts using the revenue recognition guidance in Topic 606. At the acquisition date, the acquirer applies the revenue model as if it had originated the acquired contracts. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted this ASU prospectively on January 1, 2023. This ASU has not and is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. This ASU eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditors that have adopted ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which we adopted on January 1, 2020. This ASU also enhances the disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancing and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. In addition, the ASU amends the guidance on vintage disclosures to require entities to disclose current period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases within the scope of ASC 326-20. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted the ASU prospectively on January 1, 2023. This ASU has not and is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) was enacted into law and is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022. The IRA includes multiple incentives to promote clean energy, electric vehicles, battery and energy storage manufacture or purchase, in addition to a new corporate alternative minimum tax of 15 % on adjusted financial statement income of corporations with profits greater than $ 1 billion. Some of these measures are expected to materially affect our consolidated financial statements. For the three month period ended March 31, 2023, the impact was primarily a reduction of our material costs. We will continue to evaluate the effects of IRA as more guidance is issued and the relevant implications to our consolidated financial statements. Note 2 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements (“ASC 820” ) states that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The three-tiered fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes which inputs should be used in measuring fair value, is comprised of: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level II) inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and (Level III) unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data. The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available in determining fair value. Our assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows (in millions): March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Fair Value Level I Level II Level III Fair Value Level I Level II Level III Money market funds $ 483 $ 483 $ — $ — $ 2,188 $ 2,188 $ — $ — U.S. government securities 1,418 — 1,418 — 894 — 894 — Corporate debt securities 836 — 836 — 885 — 885 — Certificates of deposit and time deposits 4,550 — 4,550 — 4,253 — 4,253 — Total $ 7,287 $ 483 $ 6,804 $ — $ 8,220 $ 2,188 $ 6,032 $ — All of our money market funds were classified within Level I of the fair value hierarchy because they were valued using quoted prices in active markets. Our U.S. government securities, certificates of deposit, time deposits and corporate debt securities are classified within Level II of the fair value hierarchy and the market approach was used to determine fair value of these investments. 13 Our cash, cash equivalents and investments classified by security type as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 consisted of the following (in millions): March 31, 2023 Adjusted Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Cash and Cash Equivalents Short-Term Investments Cash $ 15,115 $ — $ — $ 15,115 $ 15,115 $ — Money market funds 483 — — 483 483 — U.S. government securities 1,420 — ( 2 ) 1,418 — 1,418 Corporate debt securities 852 1 ( 17 ) 836 — 836 Certificates of deposit and time deposits 4,550 — — 4,550 450 4,100 Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments $ 22,420 $ 1 $ ( 19 ) $ 22,402 $ 16,048 $ 6,354 December 31, 2022 Adjusted Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Cash and Cash Equivalents Short-Term Investments Cash $ 13,965 $ — $ — $ 13,965 $ 13,965 $ — Money market funds 2,188 — — 2,188 2,188 — U.S. government securities 897 — ( 3 ) 894 — 894 Corporate debt securities 907 — ( 22 ) 885 — 885 Certificates of deposit and time deposits 4,252 1 — 4,253 100 4,153 Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments $ 22,209 $ 1 $ ( 25 ) $ 22,185 $ 16,253 $ 5,932 We record gross realized gains, losses and credit losses as a component of Other (expense) income, net in the consolidated statements of operations. For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, we did not recognize any material gross realized gains, losses or credit losses. The ending allowance balances for credit losses were immaterial as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. We have determined that the gross unrealized losses on our investments as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were temporary in nature. The following table summarizes the fair value of our investments by stated contractual maturities as of March 31, 2023 (in millions): Due in 1 year or less $ 5,637 Due in 1 year through 5 years 569 Due in 5 years through 10 years 148 Total $ 6,354 Disclosure of Fair Values Our financial instruments that are not re-measured at fair value include accounts receivable, financing receivables, digital assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, customer deposits and debt. The carrying values of these financial instruments approximate their fair values, other than our 2.00 % Convertible Senior Notes due in 2024 (“2024 Notes”) and digital assets. We estimate the fair value of the 2024 Notes using commonly accepted valuation methodologies and market-based risk measurements that are indirectly observable, such as credit risk (Level II). In addition, we estimate the fair values of our digital assets based on quoted prices in active markets (Level I). The following table presents the estimated fair values and the carrying values (in millions): March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value 2024 Notes $ 37 $ 375 $ 37 $ 223 Digital assets, net $ 184 $ 325 $ 184 $ 191 14 Note 3 – Inventory Our inventory consisted of the following (in millions): March 31, December 31, 2023 2022 Raw materials $ 6,405 $ 6,137 Work in process 2,458 2,385 Finished goods (1) 4,591 3,475 Service parts 921 842 Total $ 14,375 $ 12,839 (1) Finished goods inventory includes vehicles in transit to fulfill customer orders, new vehicles available for sale, used vehicles and energy products available for sale. We write-down inventory for any excess or obsolete inventories or when we believe that the net realizable value of inventories is less than the carrying value. During the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, we recorded write-downs of $ 39 million and $ 26 million, respectively, in Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Note 4 – Property, Plant and Equipment, Net Our property, plant and equipment, net, consisted of the following (in millions): March 31, December 31, 2023 2022 Machinery, equipment, vehicles and office furniture $ 14,139 $ 13,558 Tooling 2,696 2,579 Leasehold improvements 2,551 2,366 Land and buildings 8,144 7,751 Computer equipment, hardware and software 2,299 2,072 Construction in progress 4,894 4,263 34,723 32,589 Less: Accumulated depreciation ( 9,754 ) ( 9,041 ) Total $ 24,969 $ 23,548 Construction in progress is primarily comprised of construction of Gigafactory Texas and Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg, and equipment and tooling related to the manufacturing of our products.

Recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to our general assets of the respective guarantors. Non-recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to only assets of our subsidiaries. The differences between the unpaid principal balances and the net carrying values are due to debt discounts or deferred financing costs. As of March 31, 2023, we were in material compliance with all financial debt covenants. 16 2024 Notes During the first quarter of 2023, the closing price of our common stock continued to exceed 130 % of the applicable conversion price of our 2024 Notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter, causing the 2024 Notes to be convertible by their holders during the second quarter of 2023. Should the closing price conditions continue to be met in a future quarter for the 2024 Notes, the 2024 Notes will be convertible at their holders’ option during the immediately following quarter. Note 8 – Equity Incentive Plans Other Performance-Based Grants 2021 Performance-Based Stock Option & Restricted Stock Unit (“RSU”) Awards During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors granted to certain employees performance-based RSUs and stock options to purchase an aggregate 2.2 million shares of our common stock, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. As of March 31, 2023, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $ 170 million, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3 years. For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, we recorded $ 25 million and $ 69 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense related to this grant, net of forfeitures. Summary Stock-Based Compensation Information The following table summarizes our stock-based compensation expense by line item in the consolidated statements of operations (in millions): Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 Cost of revenues $ 192 $ 131 Research and development 134 143 Selling, general and administrative 92 144 Total $ 418 $ 418 Our income tax benefits recognized from stock-based compensation arrangements in each of the periods presented were immaterial due to cumulative losses and valuation allowances. Note 9 – Commitments and Contingencies Operating Lease Arrangements in Buffalo, New York and Shanghai, China For a description of our operating lease arrangements in Buffalo, New York, and Shanghai, China, refer to Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies , in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. As of March 31, 2023, we expect to meet the requirements under these arrangements based on our current and anticipated level of operations. Legal Proceedings Litigation Relating to the SolarCity Acquisition Between September 1, 2016 and October 5, 2016, seven lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery by purported stockholders of Tesla challenging our acquisition of SolarCity Corporation (“SolarCity”). Following consolidation, the lawsuit names as defendants the members of Tesla’s board of directors as then constituted and alleges, among other things, that board members breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the acquisition. The complaint asserts both derivative claims and direct claims on behalf of a purported class and seeks, among other relief, unspecified monetary damages, attorneys’ fees and costs. On January 22, 2020, all of the director defendants except Elon Musk reached a settlement to resolve the lawsuit against them for an amount to be paid entirely under the applicable insurance policy. The settlement, which does not involve an admission of any wrongdoing by any party, was approved by the Court on August 17, 2020. Tesla received payment of approximately $ 43 million on September 16, 2020, which has been recognized in our consolidated statements of operations as a reduction to Selling, general and administrative operating expenses for costs previously incurred related to the acquisition of SolarCity. The trial was held from July 12 to July 23, 2021 and on August 16, 2021. On October 22, 2021, the Court approved the parties’ joint stipulation that (a) the class is decertified and the action shall continue exclusively as a derivative action under Court of Chancery Rule 23.1 and (b) the direct claims against Elon Musk are dismissed with prejudice. Following post-trial briefing, post-trial argument was held on January 18, 2022. On April 27, 2022, the Court entered judgment in favor of Mr. Musk on all counts. On May 26, 2022, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal. Oral argument was held before the Supreme Court of Delaware on March 29, 2023. These plaintiffs and others filed parallel actions in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on or about April 21, 2017. They include claims for violations of the federal securities laws and breach of fiduciary duties by Tesla’s board of directors. Those actions have been consolidated and stayed pending the above-referenced Chancery Court litigation. 17 Litigation Relating to 2018 CEO Performance Award On June 4, 2018, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a putative class and derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Elon Musk and the members of Tesla’s board of directors as then constituted, alleging corporate waste, unjust enrichment and that such board members breached their fiduciary duties by approving the stock-based compensation plan awarded to Elon Musk in 2018. The complaint seeks, among other things, monetary damages and rescission or reformation of the stock-based compensation plan. On August 31, 2018, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint; plaintiff filed its opposition brief on November 1, 2018; and defendants filed a reply brief on December 13, 2018. The hearing on the motion to dismiss was held on May 9, 2019. On September 20, 2019, the Court granted the motion to dismiss as to the corporate waste claim but denied the motion as to the breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims. Defendants’ answer was filed on December 3, 2019. On January 25, 2021, the Court conditionally certified certain claims and a class of Tesla stockholders as a class action. On September 30, 2021, plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file a verified amended derivative complaint. On October 1, 2021, defendants Kimbal Musk and Steve Jurvetson moved for summary judgment as to the claims against them. Following the motion, plaintiff agreed to voluntarily dismiss the claims against Kimbal Musk and Steve Jurvetson. Plaintiff also moved for summary judgment on October 1, 2021. On October 27, 2021, the Court approved the parties’ joint stipulation that, among other things, (a) all claims against Kimbal Musk and Steve Jurvetson in the Complaint are dismissed with prejudice; (b) the class is decertified and the action shall continue exclusively as a derivative action under Court of Chancery Rule 23.1; and (c) the direct claims against the remaining defendants are dismissed with prejudice. On November 18, 2021, the remaining defendants (a) moved for partial summary judgment, (b) opposed plaintiff’s summary judgment motion and (c) opposed the plaintiff’s motion to amend his complaint. In January 2022, the case was assigned to a different judge. On February 24, 2022, the court (i) granted plaintiff’s motion to amend his complaint, and (ii) canceled oral argument on the summary judgment motions, stating that the court is “skeptical that this litigation can be resolved based on the undisputed facts” and the “case is going to trial,” but that the “parties may reassert their arguments made in support of summary judgment in their pre-trial and post-trial briefs.” Trial was held November 14-18, 2022. Post-trial briefing and argument are now complete. Litigation Related to Directors’ Compensation On June 17, 2020, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla’s current and former directors regarding compensation awards granted to Tesla’s directors, other than Elon Musk, between 2017 and 2020. The suit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages and other relief. Defendants filed their answer on September 17, 2020. Trial is currently set for November 27, 2023, to December 1, 2023. Litigation Relating to Potential Going Private Transaction Between August 10, 2018 and September 6, 2018, nine purported stockholder class actions were filed against Tesla and Elon Musk in connection with Mr. Musk’s August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. On January 16, 2019, Plaintiffs filed their consolidated complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and added as defendants the members of Tesla’s board of directors. The consolidated complaint asserts claims for violations of the federal securities laws and seeks unspecified damages and other relief. The parties stipulated to certification of a class of stockholders, which the court granted on November 25, 2020. Trial started on January 17, 2023, and on February 3, 2023, a jury rendered a verdict in favor of the defendants on all counts. After trial, plaintiffs filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law and a motion for new trial, which the defendants opposed. Between October 17, 2018 and March 8, 2021, seven derivative lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of Tesla’s board of directors, as constituted at relevant times, in relation to statements made and actions connected to a potential going private transaction, with certain of the lawsuits challenging additional Twitter posts by Mr. Musk, among other things. Five of those actions were consolidated, and all seven actions have been stayed pending resolution of the above-referenced consolidated purported stockholder class action. In addition to these cases, two derivative lawsuits were filed on October 25, 2018 and February 11, 2019 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of the Tesla board of directors as then constituted. Those cases have also been consolidated and stayed pending the entry of judgment in the above-referenced consolidated purported stockholder class action. On October 21, 2022, a lawsuit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery by a purported shareholder of Tesla alleging, among other things, that board members breached their fiduciary duties in connection with their oversight of the Company’s 2018 settlement with the SEC, as amended. Among other things, the plaintiff seeks reforms to the Company’s corporate governance and internal procedures, unspecified damages, and attorneys’ fees. The parties reached an agreement to stay the case until June 5, 2023. 18 On November 15, 2021, JPMorgan Chase Bank (“JP Morgan”) filed a lawsuit against Tesla in the Southern District of New York alleging breach of a stock warrant agreement that was entered into as part of a convertible notes offering in 2014. In 2018, JP Morgan informed Tesla that it had adjusted the strike price based upon Mr. Musk’s August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. Tesla disputed JP Morgan’s adjustment as a violation of the parties’ agreement. In 2021, Tesla delivered shares to JP Morgan per the agreement, which they duly accepted. JP Morgan now alleges that it is owed approximately $ 162 million as the value of additional shares that it claims should have been delivered as a result of the adjustment to the strike price in 2018. On January 24, 2022, Tesla filed multiple counterclaims as part of its answer to the underlying lawsuit, asserting among other points that JP Morgan should have terminated the stock warrant agreement in 2018 rather than make an adjustment to the strike price that it should have known would lead to a commercially unreasonable result. Tesla believes that the adjustments made by JP Morgan were neither proper nor commercially reasonable, as required under the stock warrant agreements. JP Morgan filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, which Tesla opposed, and that motion is currently pending before the Court. Litigation and Investigations Relating to Alleged Discrimination and Harassment On October 4, 2021, in a case captioned Diaz v. Tesla , a jury in the Northern District of California returned a verdict against Tesla on claims by a former contingent worker that he was subjected to race discrimination while assigned to work at Tesla’s Fremont Factory from 2015-2016. On November 16, 2021, Tesla filed a post-trial motion for relief that included a request for a new trial or reduction of the jury’s damages. On April 13, 2022, the Court granted Tesla’s motion in part, reducing the total damages and conditionally denied the motion for a new trial subject to the plaintiff’s acceptance of the reduced award. On June 21, 2022, the plaintiff rejected the reduced award and, as a result, on June 27, 2022, the Court ordered a new trial on damages only, which commenced on March 27, 2023, after which a jury returned a verdict of $ 3,175,000 . As a result, the damages awarded against Tesla were reduced from an initial $ 136.9 million (October 4, 2021) down to $ 15 million (April 13, 2022), and then further down to $ 3.175 million (April 3, 2023). On February 9, 2022, shortly after the first Diaz jury verdict, the California Civil Rights Department (”CRD,” formerly “DFEH”) filed a civil complaint against Tesla in Alameda County, California Superior Court, alleging systemic race discrimination, hostile work environment and pay equity claims, among others. CRD’s amended complaint seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief. On September 22, 2022, Tesla filed a cross complaint against CRD, alleging that it violated the Administrative Procedures Act by failing to follow statutory pre-requisites prior to filing suit and that cross complaint was subject to a sustained demurrer, which Tesla later amended and refiled. The case is now in discovery. Additionally, on June 1, 2022 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) issued a cause finding against Tesla that closely parallels the CRD’s allegations. Tesla will engage in a mandatory mediation with the EEOC in June 2023. On June 16, 2022, two Tesla stockholders filed separate derivative actions in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla’s current and former directors. Both suits assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and violation of the federal securities laws in connection with alleged race and gender discrimination and sexual harassment. Among other things, plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages payable to Tesla, and attorneys’ fees. On July 22, 2022, the Court consolidated the two cases and on September 6, 2022, plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. On November 7, 2022, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the case. Plaintiffs filed a response of January 13, 2023, and the defendants replied on February 17, 2023. Other Litigation Related to Our Products and Services We are also subject to various lawsuits, including proposed class actions, that seek monetary and other injunctive relief. For example, on September 14, 2022, a proposed class action was filed against Tesla, Inc. and related entities in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging various claims about the Company’s driver assistance technology systems under state and federal law. This case was later consolidated with several other proposed class actions, and a Consolidated Amended Complaint was filed on October 28, 2022, which seeks damages and other relief on behalf of all persons who purchased or leased from Tesla between January 1, 2016 to the present. On October 5, 2022 a proposed class action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York asserting similar state and federal law claims against the same defendants. On March 22, 2023, the plaintiffs in the California consolidated action filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to order Tesla to (1) cease using the term “Full Self-Driving Capability” (FSDC), (2) cease the sale and activation of FSDC and deactivate FSDC on Tesla vehicles, and (3) provide certain notices to consumers about proposed court-findings about the accuracy of the use of the terms Autopilot and FSDC. 19 On February 27, 2023, a proposed class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against Tesla, Inc., Elon Musk and certain current and former Company executives. The complaint alleges that the defendants made material misrepresentations and omissions about the Company’s Autopilot and FSDC technologies and seeks money damages and other relief on behalf of persons who purchased Tesla stock between February 19, 2019 and February 17, 2023. On April 13, 2023, a putative Tesla shareholder filed a related shareholder derivative complaint against the members of Tesla’s board of directors and certain current and former executives, alleging contribution for violations of the federal securities law, breach of fiduciary duties, waste, and unjust enrichment. The complaint asserts derivative claims and seeks, among other relief, unspecified monetary damages, attorneys’ fees and costs. On March 14, 2023 a proposed class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Several similar complaints have also been filed in the same court. These complaints allege that Tesla violates federal antitrust and warranty laws through its repair, service, and maintenance practices and seeks, among other relief, damages for persons who paid Tesla for repairs services or Tesla compatible replacement parts from March 2019 to March 2023. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself in these matters; however, we cannot predict the outcome or impact. We are unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these claims, unless noted. Certain Investigations and Other Matters We receive requests for information from regulators and governmental authorities, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board, the SEC, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and various state, federal, and international agencies. We routinely cooperate with such regulatory and governmental requests, including subpoenas, formal and informal requests and other investigations and inquiries. For example, the SEC had issued subpoenas to Tesla in connection with Elon Musk’s prior statement that he was considering taking Tesla private. The take-private investigation was resolved and closed with a settlement entered into with the SEC in September 2018 and as further clarified in April 2019 in an amendment. The SEC also has periodically issued subpoenas to us seeking information on our governance processes around compliance with the SEC settlement, as amended. Separately, the company has received requests from the DOJ for documents related to Tesla’s Autopilot and FSD features. To our knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. We cannot predict the outcome or impact of any ongoing matters. Should the government decide to pursue an enforcement action, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation, prospects, cash flows and financial position. We are also subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that arise from the normal course of business activities. If an unfavorable ruling or development were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position and brand. 20 Note 10 – Variable Interest Entity Arrangements The aggregate carrying values of the variable interest entities’ assets and liabilities, after elimination of any intercompany transactions and balances, in the consolidated balance sheets were as follows (in millions): March 31, December 31, 2023 2022 Assets Current assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 58 $ 68 Accounts receivable, net 29 22 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 265 274 Total current assets 352 364 Solar energy systems, net 4,014 4,060 Other non-current assets 390 404 Total assets $ 4,756 $ 4,828 Liabilities Current liabilities Accrued liabilities and other $ 59 $ 69 Deferred revenue 9 10 Current portion of debt and finance leases 931 1,013 Total current liabilities 999 1,092 Deferred revenue, net of current portion 148 149 Debt and finance leases, net of current portion 761 971 Other long-term liabilities 3 3 Total liabilities $ 1,911 $ 2,215 Note 11 – Segment Reporting and Information about Geographic Areas We have two operating and reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Overview Our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. We design, develop, manufacture, lease and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles, solar energy generation systems and energy storage products. We also offer maintenance, installation, operation, financial and other services related to our products. Additionally, we are increasingly focused on products and services based on artificial intelligence, robotics and automation. In 2023, we produced 440,808 consumer vehicles and delivered 422,875 consumer vehicles through the first quarter. We are currently focused on increasing vehicle production, capacity and delivery capabilities, reducing costs, improving and developing battery technologies, improving our FSD capabilities, increasing the affordability and efficiency of our vehicles, bringing new products to market and expanding our global infrastructure. In 2023, we deployed 3.89 GWh of energy storage products and 67 megawatts of solar energy systems through the first quarter. We are currently focused on ramping production of energy storage products, improving our Solar Roof installation capability and efficiency, and increasing market share of retrofit solar energy systems. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we recognized total revenues of $23.33 billion, representing an increase of $4.57 billion, compared to the prior year. We continue to ramp production, build new manufacturing capacity and expand our operations to enable increased deliveries and deployments of our products and further revenue growth. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, our net income attributable to common stockholders was $2.51 billion, representing an unfavorable change of $805 million, compared to the prior year. We continue to focus on improving our profitability through production and operational efficiencies. We ended the first quarter of 2023 with $22.40 billion in cash and cash equivalents and investments, representing an increase of $217 million from the end of 2022. Our cash flows provided by operating activities during the three months ended March 2023 and 2022 were $2.51 billion and $4.00 billion, respectively, representing a decrease of $1.48 billion. Capital expenditures amounted to $2.07 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $1.77 billion during the same period ended March 31, 2022. Sustained growth has allowed our business to generally fund itself, and we will continue investing in a number of capital-intensive projects in upcoming periods. Management Opportunities, Challenges and Uncertainties and 2023 Outlook Automotive—Production The following is a summary of the status of production of each of our announced vehicle models in production and under development, as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q: Production Location Vehicle Model(s) Production Status Fremont Factory Model S / Model X Active Model 3 / Model Y Active Gigafactory Shanghai Model 3 / Model Y Active Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg Model Y Active Gigafactory Texas Model Y Active Cybertruck Tooling Gigafactory Nevada Tesla Semi Pilot production TBD Tesla Roadster In development TBD Robotaxi & Others In development We are focused on growing our manufacturing capacity, which includes ramping all of our production vehicles to their installed production capacities as well as increasing production rate, efficiency and capacity at our current factories. The next phase of production growth will depend on the ramp at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas, as well as our ability to add to our available sources of battery cell supply by manufacturing our own cells that we are developing to have high-volume output, lower capital and production costs and longer range. Our goals are to improve vehicle performance, decrease production costs and increase affordability and customer awareness. 23 However, these plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations, which may be exacerbated by the new product and manufacturing technologies we are introducing, the number of concurrent international projects, any industry-wide component constraints, labor shortages and any future impact from events outside of our control such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, we have set ambitious technological targets with our plans for battery cells as well as for iterative manufacturing and design improvements for our vehicles with each new factory. Automotive—Demand, Sales, Deliveries and Infrastructure Our cost reduction efforts, cost innovation strategies, and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our vehicles’ affordability, and for example, have allowed us to competitively price our vehicles. We will also continue to generate demand and brand awareness by improving our vehicles’ performance and functionality, including through products based on artificial intelligence such as Autopilot and FSD, and other software features, and delivering new vehicles, such as our upcoming Cybertruck. Moreover, we expect to continue to benefit from ongoing electrification of the automotive sector and increasing environmental awareness. However, we operate in a cyclical industry that is sensitive to political and regulatory uncertainty, including with respect to trade and the environment, all of which can be compounded by inflationary pressures, rising energy prices, increases in interest rates and the liquidity of enterprise customers. For example, inflationary pressures have increased across the markets in which we operate. In an effort to curb this trend, central banks in developed countries raised interest rates rapidly and substantially, impacting the affordability of vehicle lease and finance arrangements. Further, sales of vehicles in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to increased volatility as we expand and adjust our operations. Moreover, as additional competitors enter the marketplace and help bring the world closer to sustainable transportation, we will have to adjust and continue to execute well to maintain our momentum. These macroeconomic and industry trends have had, and will likely continue to have, an impact on the pricing of, and order rate for our vehicles, and in turn our operating margin. We will continue to adjust accordingly to such developments, and we believe our ongoing cost reduction, including improved production innovation and efficiency at our newest factories and lower logistics costs, and focus on operating leverage will continue to benefit us in relation to our competitors. As our production increases, we must work constantly to similarly increase vehicle delivery capability so that it does not become a bottleneck on our total deliveries. We are also committed to reducing the percentage of vehicles delivered in the third month of each quarter, which will help to reduce the cost per vehicle. As we expand our manufacturing operations globally, we will also have to continue to increase and staff our delivery, servicing and charging infrastructure accordingly, maintain our vehicle reliability and optimize our Supercharger locations to ensure cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction. In particular, we remain focused on increasing the capability and efficiency of our servicing operations. Energy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment The long-term success of this business is dependent upon increasing margins through greater volumes. We continue to increase the production of our energy storage products to meet high levels of demand, including the announcement of a new Megafactory in Shanghai. For Megapack, energy storage deployments can vary meaningfully quarter to quarter depending on the timing of specific project milestones. For Powerwall, better availability and growing grid stability concerns drive higher customer interest. We remain committed to growing our retrofit solar energy business by offering a low-cost and simplified online ordering experience. In addition, we continue to seek to improve our installation capabilities and price efficiencies for Solar Roof. As these product lines grow, we will have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage products and hire additional personnel, particularly skilled electricians, to support the ramp of Solar Roof. 24 Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends Our capital expenditures are typically difficult to project beyond the short-term given the number and breadth of our core projects at any given time, and may further be impacted by uncertainties in future global market conditions. We are simultaneously ramping new products, ramping manufacturing facilities on three continents, piloting the development and manufacture of new battery cell technologies and investing in autonomy and other artificial intelligence enabled products, and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending on overall priority among projects, the pace at which we meet milestones, production adjustments to and among our various products, increased capital efficiencies and the addition of new projects. Owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced projects under development, all other continuing infrastructure growth and varying levels of inflation, we currently expect our capital expenditures to be between $7.00 to $9.00 billion in 2023 and in each of the following two fiscal years. Our business has recently been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend, and with better working capital management resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding, our sales growth is also facilitating positive cash generation. We have and will continue to utilize such cash flows, among other things, to do more vertical integration, expand our product roadmap and provide financing options to our customers. On the other hand, we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods depending on the specific pace of our capital-intensive projects and rising material prices and increasing supply chain and labor expenses resulting from changes in global trade conditions and labor availability associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, we expect our ability to be self-funding to continue as long as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates For a description of our critical accounting policies and estimates, refer to Part II, Item 7, Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Results of Operations Revenues Three Months Ended March 31, Change (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 $ % Automotive sales $ 18,878 $ 15,514 $ 3,364 22 % Automotive regulatory credits 521 679 (158 ) (23 )% Automotive leasing 564 668 (104 ) (16 )% Total automotive revenues 19,963 16,861 3,102 18 % Services and other 1,837 1,279 558 44 % Total automotive & services and other segment revenue 21,800 18,140 3,660 20 % Energy generation and storage segment revenue 1,529 616 913 148 % Total revenues $ 23,329 $ 18,756 $ 4,573 24 % 25 Automotive & Services and Other Segment Automotive sales revenue increased $3.36 billion, or 22%, in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily due to an increase of 108,378 combined Model 3 and Model Y deliveries year over year despite a negative impact from the United States dollar strengthening against other foreign currencies in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the prior period. This was achieved from production ramping of Model Y at Gigafactory Shanghai, Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg, Gigafactory Texas and the Fremont Factory. This increase was partially offset by lower average selling price on our vehicles driven by overall price reductions year over year. There was also a decrease of 2,630 Model S and Model X deliveries year over year. Automotive regulatory credits revenue decreased $158 million, or 23%, in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022. We recognized $288 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2022 primarily due to changes in regulation which entitled us to additional consideration for credits sold previously, in the absence of which we had an increase in automotive regulatory credits revenue year over year. This increase was primarily due to the increase in volume as well as the regional mix of the credits sold. Automotive leasing revenue decreased $104 million, or 16%, in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022. The change is primarily due to a decrease in direct sales-type leasing revenue driven by lower deliveries year over year. This was partially offset by an increase from the growing portfolio of our direct operating lease program. Services and other revenue increased $558 million, or 44%, in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022. The change is primarily due to an increase in used vehicle revenue driven by increases in volume offset by decreases in average selling price of used Tesla and non-Tesla vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continues to grow, paid Supercharging revenue, insurance services revenue and retail merchandise revenue. Energy Generation and Storage Segment Energy generation and storage revenue increased $913 million, or 148%, in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily due to an increase in deployments of Megapack, higher solar cash and loan deployments at a higher average selling price, as well as increase in deployments of Powerwall at a higher average selling price, year over year. Cost of Revenues and Gross Margin Three Months Ended March 31, Change (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 $ % Cost of revenues Automotive sales $ 15,422 $ 10,914 $ 4,508 41 % Automotive leasing 333 408 (75 ) (18 )% Total automotive cost of revenues 15,755 11,322 4,433 39 % Services and other 1,702 1,286 416 32 % Total automotive & services and other segment cost of revenues 17,457 12,608 4,849 38 % Energy generation and storage segment 1,361 688 673 98 % Total cost of revenues $ 18,818 $ 13,296 $ 5,522 42 % Gross profit total automotive $ 4,208 $ 5,539 Gross margin total automotive 21.1 % 32.9 % Gross profit total automotive & services and other segment $ 4,343 $ 5,532 Gross margin total automotive & services and other segment 19.9 % 30.5 % Gross profit energy generation and storage segment $ 168 $ (72 ) Gross margin energy generation and storage segment 11.0 % (11.7 )% Total gross profit $ 4,511 $ 5,460 Total gross margin 19.3 % 29.1 % 26 Automotive & Services and Other Segment Cost of automotive sales revenue increased $4.51 billion, or 41%, in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022, in line with the growth in deliveries year over year, as discussed above. Further, the average combined cost per unit of our vehicles increased year over year due to increasing prices of raw materials, manufacturing, logistics and warranty costs. These costs were partially offset by manufacturing credits earned as part of the IRA during the three months ended March 31, 2023. There were also idle capacity charges primarily related to the ramping up of production in Gigafactory Texas and our proprietary battery cells manufacturing during the three months ended March 31, 2023. We had also incurred costs related to the ramp up of production in Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg during the three months ended March 31, 2022. These increases in costs of revenue were positively impacted by the United States dollar strengthening against other foreign currencies in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the prior period. Cost of automotive leasing revenue decreased $75 million, or 18%, in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily due to a decrease in direct sales-type leasing cost of revenue driven by lower deliveries year over year. This was partially offset by an increase in cost of revenue from the growing portfolio of our direct operating lease program. Cost of services and other revenue increased $416 million, or 32%, in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022. The change is primarily due to an increase in used vehicle cost of revenue driven by increases in volume offset by a decrease in costs of used Tesla and non-Tesla vehicle sales, an increase in non-warranty maintenance service cost of revenue, and an increase in costs of paid Supercharging, insurance services and retail merchandise. Gross margin for total automotive decreased from 32.9% to 21.1% in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022. This was driven by the changes in automotive sales revenue and cost of automotive sales revenue, as well as a decrease in regulatory credits revenue, as discussed earlier. Gross margin for total automotive & services and other segment decreased from 30.5% to 19.9% in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily due to the automotive gross margin decrease discussed above, partially offset by an improvement in our services and other gross margin. Additionally, services and other was a higher percentage of the segment gross margin during the first quarter of 2023 as compared to the prior year. Energy Generation and Storage Segment Cost of energy generation and storage revenue increased $673 million, or 98%, in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily due to increase in deployments of Megapack, increase in solar cash and loan deployments at a higher average cost due to increased component costs, as well as increase in deployments of Powerwall. Gross margin for energy generation and storage improved from -11.7% to 11.0% in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022. This was driven by the growth in energy generation and storage revenue and cost of energy generation and storage revenue as discussed above. Additionally, there was a higher proportion of energy storage sales, which operated at a higher gross margin, within the segment. 27 Research and Development Expense Three Months Ended March 31, Change (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 $ % Research and development $ 771 $ 865 $ (94 ) (11 )% As a percentage of revenues 3 % 5 % Research and development (“R&D”) expenses decreased $94 million, or 11%, in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022. The overall decrease was primarily driven by additional costs in the three months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to the current period, as we were in the pre-production phase at Gigafactory Texas and started production at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg only closer to the end of the first quarter of 2022. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 5% to 3% in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022. Our R&D expenses have decreased as a proportion of total revenues despite expanding product roadmap and technologies. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Three Months Ended March 31, Change (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 $ % Selling, general and administrative $ 1,076 $ 992 $ 84 8 % As a percentage of revenues 5 % 5 % Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses increased $84 million, or 8%, in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022. This was driven by a $84 million increase in facilities-related expenses and a $49 million increase in employee and labor costs primarily from increased headcount, including professional services. These increases were offset by a decrease of $52 million in stock-based compensation expense, most of which is attributable to the lower stock-based compensation expense of $48 million on the 2018 CEO Performance Award which was fully expensed as of December 31, 2022. Interest Income Three Months Ended March 31, Change (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 $ % Interest income $ 213 $ 28 $ 185 661 % Interest income increased $185 million, or 661%, in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022. This increase was primarily due to higher interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments during the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the prior period. This was driven by an increase in our short-term investments balance and rising interest rates. Other (Expense) Income, Net Three Months Ended March 31, Change (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 $ % Other (expense) income, net $ (48 ) $ 56 $ (104 ) Not meaningful Other (expense) income, net, changed unfavorably by $104 million in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022. The change is primarily due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 28 Provision for Income Taxes Three Months Ended March 31, Change (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 $ % Provision for income taxes $ 261 $ 346 $ (85 ) (25 )% Effective tax rate 9 % 10 % Our provision for income taxes decreased by $85 million, or 25%, in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily due to the change in our pre-tax income year over year. Our effective tax rate decreased from 10% to 9% in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily due to changes in mix of jurisdictional earnings. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details. Liquidity and Capital Resources We expect to continue to generate net positive operating cash flow as we have done in the last four fiscal years. The cash we generate from our core operations enables us to fund ongoing operations and production, our research and development projects for new products and technologies including our proprietary battery cells, additional manufacturing ramps at existing manufacturing facilities such as the Fremont Factory, Gigafactory Nevada, Gigafactory Shanghai and Gigafactory New York, the ramp of Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas, the construction of future factories, and the continued expansion of our retail and service locations, body shops, Mobile Service fleet, Supercharger network, energy product installation capabilities and autonomy and other artificial intelligence enabled products. In addition, because a large portion of our future expenditures will be to fund our growth, we expect that if needed we will be able to adjust our capital and operating expenditures by operating segment. For example, if our near-term manufacturing operations decrease in scale or ramp more slowly than expected, including due to global economic or business conditions, we may choose to correspondingly slow the pace of our capital expenditures. Finally, we continually evaluate our cash needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital or seek alternative financing sources to fund the rapid growth of our business, including through drawdowns on existing or new debt facilities or financing funds. Conversely, we may also from time to time determine that it is in our best interests to voluntarily repay certain indebtedness early. Accordingly, we believe that our current sources of funds will provide us with adequate liquidity during the 12-month period following March 31, 2023, as well as in the long-term. See the sections below for more details regarding the material requirements for cash in our business and our sources of liquidity to meet such needs. Material Cash Requirements From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with vendors for the purchase of components and raw materials to be used in the manufacture of our products. However, due to contractual terms, variability in the precise growth curves of our development and production ramps, and opportunities to renegotiate pricing, we generally do not have binding and enforceable purchase orders under such contracts beyond the short-term, and the timing and magnitude of purchase orders beyond such period is difficult to accurately project. As discussed in and subject to the considerations referenced in Part I, Item 2, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Management Opportunities, Challenges and Uncertainties and 2023 Outlook—Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we currently expect our capital expenditures to support our projects globally to be between $7.00 to $9.00 billion in 2023 and in each of the following two fiscal years. We also have certain obligations in connection with our operations at Gigafactory New York and Gigafactory Shanghai, as outlined in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Material Cash Requirements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. As of March 31, 2023, we and our subsidiaries had outstanding $1.77 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness, of which $939 million is scheduled to become due in the succeeding 12 months. For details regarding our indebtedness, refer to Note 7, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 29 Sources and Conditions of Liquidity Our sources to fund our material cash requirements are predominantly from our deliveries and servicing of new and used vehicles, sales and installations of our energy storage products and solar energy systems, proceeds from debt facilities and proceeds from equity offerings, when applicable. As of March 31, 2023, we had $16.05 billion and $6.35 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, respectively. Balances held in foreign currencies had a U.S. dollar equivalent of $4.26 billion and consisted primarily of Chinese yuan, euros and Canadian dollar. We had $5.16 billion of unused committed amounts under our credit facilities as of March 31, 2023. Certain of such unused committed amounts are subject to satisfying specified conditions prior to draw-down (such as pledging to leased vehicles and our interests in those leases). For details regarding our indebtedness, refer to Note 7 , Debt , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We continue adapting our strategy to meet our liquidity and risk objectives, such as investing in U.S. government and other investments, to do more vertical integration, expand our product roadmap and provide financing options to our customers. Summary of Cash Flows Three Months Ended March 31, (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,513 $ 3,995 Net cash used in investing activities $ (2,484 ) $ (2,167 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (233 ) $ (1,914 ) Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $1.48 billion to $2.51 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2023 from $4.00 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily due to the overall increase in net operating assets and liabilities of $928 million and the decrease in net income excluding non-cash expenses, gains and losses of $554 million. The increase in our net operating assets and liabilities was mainly driven by a larger increase of inventory in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Cash flows from investing activities and their variability across each period related primarily to capital expenditures, which were $2.07 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and $1.77 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2022, mainly for the expansions of Gigafactory Texas, the Fremont Factory, Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg, and Gigafactory Shanghai. We also purchased $411 million and $386 million of investments, net of proceeds from maturities, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities decreased by $1.68 billion to $233 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023 from $1.91 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a $1.64 billion decrease in repayments of convertible and other debt. See Note 7, Debt , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details regarding our debt obligations. 30 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Risk We transact business globally in multiple currencies and hence have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, costs of revenue, operating expenses and localized subsidiary debt denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (primarily the Chinese yuan, euro, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar in relation to our current year operations). In general, we are a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar for our foreign subsidiaries. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars as we do not typically hedge foreign currency risk. We have also experienced, and will continue to experience, fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local currency (primarily consisting of our intercompany and cash and cash equivalents balances). We considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is reasonably possible that adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near-term. These changes were applied to our total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our local currencies at the balance sheet date to compute the impact these changes would have had on our net income before income taxes. These changes would have resulted in a gain or loss of $435 million at March 31, 2023 and $473 million at December 31, 2022, assuming no foreign currency hedging. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of March 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were designed at a reasonable assurance level and were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2023, which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 31 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS For a description of our material pending legal proceedings, please see Note 9, Commitments and Contingencies , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, each of the matters below is being disclosed pursuant to Item 103 of Regulation S-K because it relates to environmental regulations and aggregate civil penalties that we currently believe could potentially exceed $1 million. We believe that any proceeding that is material to our business or financial condition is likely to have potential penalties far in excess of such amount. District attorneys in certain California counties conducted an investigation into Tesla’s waste segregation practices pursuant to Cal. Health & Saf. Code section 25100 et seq. and Cal. Civil Code § 1798.80. Tesla has implemented various remedial measures, including conducting training and audits, and enhancements to its site waste management programs. While the outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time, it is not currently expected to have a material adverse impact on our business. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, which could adversely affect our business, financial conditions and future results. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS None. ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES None. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable. ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION None.

As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , we have recorded net financing receivables on the consolidated balance sheets, of which $ 28 million and $ 24 million, respectively, is recorded within Accounts receivable, net, for the current portion and $ 504 million and $ 387 million, respectively, is recorded within Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. Income Taxes There are transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , the aggregate balances of our gross unrecognized tax benefits were $ 1.01 billion and $ 870 million, respectively, of which $ 601 million and $ 572 million, respectively, would not give rise to changes in our effective tax rate since these tax benefits would increase a deferred tax asset that is currently fully offset by a valuation allowance. We file income tax returns in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for the years 2015 to 2018 . Additional tax years within the periods 2004 to 2014 and 2019 to 2021 remain subject to examination for federal income tax purposes. All net operating losses and tax credits generated to date are subject to adjustment for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. Our returns for 2004 and subsequent tax years remain subject to examination in U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions. Given the uncertainty in timing and outcome of our tax examinations, an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible change in gross unrecognized tax benefits within twelve months cannot be made at this time. 11 Net Income per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders The following table presents the reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders to net income used in computing basic and diluted net income per share of common stock (in millions): Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 2,703 $ 2,259 $ 5,216 $ 5,577 Less: Buy-out of noncontrolling interest 0 3 ( 5 ) 8 Net income used in computing basic net income per share of common stock 2,703 2,256 5,221 5,569 Less: Dilutive convertible debt 0 0 0 1 Net income used in computing diluted net income per share of common stock $ 2,703 $ 2,256 $ 5,221 $ 5,568 The following table presents the reconciliation of basic to diluted weighted average shares used in computing net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders, as adjusted to give effect to the three -for-one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend in August 2022 (the “2022 Stock Split”) (in millions): Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Weighted average shares used in computing net income per share of common stock, basic 3,171 3,111 3,168 3,107 Add: Stock-based awards 294 302 292 308 Convertible senior notes 2 3 2 4 Warrants 11 48 11 50 Weighted average shares used in computing net income per share of common stock, diluted 3,478 3,464 3,473 3,469 The following table presents the potentially dilutive shares that were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders, because their effect was anti-dilutive, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split (in millions): Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Stock-based awards 15 3 17 2 Restricted Cash Our total cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows, was as follows (in millions): June 30, December 31, June 30, December 31, 2023 2022 2022 2021 Cash and cash equivalents $ 15,296 $ 16,253 $ 18,324 $ 17,576 Restricted cash included in prepaid expenses and other current assets 384 294 294 345 Restricted cash included in other non-current assets 199 377 269 223 Total as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows $ 15,879 $ 16,924 $ 18,887 $ 18,144 12 Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Depending on the day of the week on which the end of a fiscal quarter falls, our accounts receivable balance may fluctuate as we are waiting for certain customer payments to clear through our banking institutions and receipts of payments from our financing partners, which can take up to approximately two weeks based on the contractual payment terms with such partners. Our accounts receivable balances associated with our sales of regulatory credits, which are typically transferred to other manufacturers during the last few days of the quarter, is dependent on contractual payment terms. Additionally, government rebates can take up to a year or more to be collected depending on the customary processing timelines of the specific jurisdictions issuing them. These various factors may have a significant impact on our accounts receivable balance from period to period. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , we had $ 330 million and $ 753 million, respectively, of long-term government rebates receivable in Other non-current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Financing Receivables As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the majority of our financing receivables were at current status with only immaterial balances being past due. As of June 30, 2023, the majority of our financing receivables, excluding MyPower notes receivable, were originated in 2023 and 2022, and as of December 31, 2022, the majority of our financing receivables, excluding MyPower notes receivable, were originated in 2022. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , the total outstanding balance of MyPower customer notes receivable, net of allowance for expected credit losses, was $ 272 million and $ 280 million, respectively, of which $ 7 million was due in the next 12 months as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , the allowance for expected credit losses was $ 37 million. Concentration of Risk Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, investments, restricted cash, accounts receivable and other finance receivables. Our cash and investments balances are primarily comprised of deposits which are diversified among high credit quality financial institutions or invested in U.S. government securities. These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , no entity represented 10 % or more of our total receivables balance. Supply Risk We are dependent on our suppliers, including single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our products in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these components from these suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Operating Lease Vehicles The gross cost of operating lease vehicles as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $ 7.13 billion and $ 6.08 billion, respectively. Operating lease vehicles on the consolidated balance sheets are presented net of accumulated depreciation of $ 1.19 billion and $ 1.04 billion as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , respectively. Goodwill Goodwill increased $ 69 million within the automotive segment from $ 194 million as of December 31, 2022 to $ 263 million as of June 30, 2023 primarily from a business combination. 13 Warranties Accrued warranty activity consisted of the following (in millions): Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Accrued warranty—beginning of period $ 3,965 $ 2,287 $ 3,505 $ 2,101 Warranty costs incurred ( 296 ) ( 187 ) ( 576 ) ( 338 ) Net changes in liability for pre-existing warranties, including expirations and foreign exchange impact 188 14 396 17 Provision for warranty 608 319 1,140 653 Accrued warranty—end of period $ 4,465 $ 2,433 $ 4,465 $ 2,433 Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently adopted accounting pronouncements In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2021-08, Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (Topic 805). This ASU requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities (deferred revenue) from acquired contracts using the revenue recognition guidance in Topic 606. At the acquisition date, the acquirer applies the revenue model as if it had originated the acquired contracts. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted this ASU prospectively on January 1, 2023. This ASU has not and is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. This ASU eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditors that have adopted ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which we adopted on January 1, 2020. This ASU also enhances the disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancing and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. In addition, the ASU amends the guidance on vintage disclosures to require entities to disclose current period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases within the scope of ASC 326-20. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted the ASU prospectively on January 1, 2023. This ASU has not and is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) was enacted into law and is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022. The IRA includes multiple incentives to promote clean energy, electric vehicles, battery and energy storage manufacture or purchase, in addition to a new corporate alternative minimum tax of 15 % on adjusted financial statement income of corporations with profits greater than $ 1 billion. Some of these measures are expected to materially affect our consolidated financial statements. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, the impact was primarily a reduction of our material costs. We will continue to evaluate the effects of IRA as more guidance is issued and the relevant implications to our consolidated financial statements. Note 2 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements (“ASC 820” ) states that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The three-tiered fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes which inputs should be used in measuring fair value, is comprised of: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level II) inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and (Level III) unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data. The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available in determining fair value. Our assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows (in millions): June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Fair Value Level I Level II Level III Fair Value Level I Level II Level III Money market funds $ 125 $ 125 $ — $ — $ 2,188 $ 2,188 $ — $ — U.S. government securities 3,811 — 3,811 — 894 — 894 — Corporate debt securities 608 — 608 — 885 — 885 — Certificates of deposit and time deposits 3,508 — 3,508 — 4,253 — 4,253 — Total $ 8,052 $ 125 $ 7,927 $ — $ 8,220 $ 2,188 $ 6,032 $ — 14 All of our money market funds were classified within Level I of the fair value hierarchy because they were valued using quoted prices in active markets. Our U.S. government securities, certificates of deposit, time deposits and corporate debt securities are classified within Level II of the fair value hierarchy and the market approach was used to determine fair value of these investments. Our cash, cash equivalents and investments classified by security type as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 consisted of the following (in millions): June 30, 2023 Adjusted Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Cash and Cash Equivalents Short-Term Investments Cash $ 15,023 $ — $ — $ 15,023 $ 15,023 $ — Money market funds 125 — — 125 125 — U.S. government securities 3,813 — ( 2 ) 3,811 148 3,663 Corporate debt securities 622 — ( 14 ) 608 — 608 Certificates of deposit and time deposits 3,511 — ( 3 ) 3,508 — 3,508 Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments $ 23,094 $ — $ ( 19 ) $ 23,075 $ 15,296 $ 7,779 December 31, 2022 Adjusted Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Cash and Cash Equivalents Short-Term Investments Cash $ 13,965 $ — $ — $ 13,965 $ 13,965 $ — Money market funds 2,188 — — 2,188 2,188 — U.S. government securities 897 — ( 3 ) 894 — 894 Corporate debt securities 907 — ( 22 ) 885 — 885 Certificates of deposit and time deposits 4,252 1 — 4,253 100 4,153 Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments $ 22,209 $ 1 $ ( 25 ) $ 22,185 $ 16,253 $ 5,932 We record gross realized gains, losses and credit losses as a component of Other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, we did not recognize any material gross realized gains, losses or credit losses. The ending allowance balances for credit losses were immaterial as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. We have determined that the gross unrealized losses on our investments as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were temporary in nature. The following table summarizes the fair value of our investments by stated contractual maturities as of June 30, 2023 (in millions): Due in 1 year or less $ 7,207 Due in 1 year through 5 years 509 Due in 5 years through 10 years 63 Total $ 7,779 Disclosure of Fair Values Our financial instruments that are not re-measured at fair value include accounts receivable, financing receivables, digital assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, customer deposits and debt. The carrying values of these financial instruments materially approximate their fair values, other than our 2.00 % Convertible Senior Notes due in 2024 (“2024 Notes”) and digital assets. We estimate the fair value of the 2024 Notes using commonly accepted valuation methodologies and market-based risk measurements that are indirectly observable, such as credit risk (Level II). In addition, we estimate the fair values of our digital assets based on quoted prices in active markets (Level I). The following table presents the estimated fair values and the carrying values (in millions): June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value 2024 Notes $ 37 $ 474 $ 37 $ 223 Digital assets, net $ 184 $ 351 $ 184 $ 191 15 Note 3 – Inventory Our inventory consisted of the following (in millions): June 30, December 31, 2023 2022 Raw materials $ 5,968 $ 6,137 Work in process 2,202 2,385 Finished goods (1) 5,193 3,475 Service parts 993 842 Total $ 14,356 $ 12,839 (1) Finished goods inventory includes vehicles in transit to fulfill customer orders, new vehicles available for sale, used vehicles and energy products available for sale. We write-down inventory for any excess or obsolete inventories or when we believe that the net realizable value of inventories is less than the carrying value. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, we recorded write-downs of $ 66 million and $ 105 million, respectively, in Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, we recorded write-downs of $ 23 million and $ 49 million, respectively, in Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations.

Recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to our general assets of the respective guarantors. Non-recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to only assets of our subsidiaries. The differences between the unpaid principal balances and the net carrying values are due to debt discounts or deferred financing costs. As of June 30, 2023, we were in material compliance with all financial debt covenants. 17 2024 Notes During the first two quarters of 2023, the closing price of our common stock continued to exceed 130 % of the applicable conversion price of our 2024 Notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter, causing the 2024 Notes to be convertible by their holders during the second and third quarters of 2023. Should the closing price conditions continue to be met in a future quarter for the 2024 Notes, the 2024 Notes will be convertible at their holders’ option during the immediately following quarter. Note 8 – Equity Incentive Plans Other Performance-Based Grants 2021 Performance-Based Stock Option & Restricted Stock Unit (“RSU”) Awards During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors granted to certain employees performance-based RSUs and stock options to purchase an aggregate 2.2 million shares of our common stock, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. As of June 30, 2023, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $ 140 million, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.75 years. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, we recorded $ 20 million and $ 45 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense related to this grant, net of forfeitures. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, we recorded $ 34 million and $ 103 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense related to this grant, net of forfeitures. Summary Stock-Based Compensation Information The following table summarizes our stock-based compensation expense by line item in the consolidated statements of operations (in millions): Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Cost of revenues $ 181 $ 143 $ 373 $ 274 Research and development 168 122 302 265 Selling, general and administrative 96 96 188 240 Total $ 445 $ 361 $ 863 $ 779 Our income tax benefits recognized from stock-based compensation arrangements in each of the periods presented were immaterial due to cumulative losses and valuation allowances. Note 9 – Commitments and Contingencies Operating Lease Arrangements in Buffalo, New York and Shanghai, China For a description of our operating lease arrangements in Buffalo, New York, and Shanghai, China, refer to Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies , in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. As of June 30, 2023, we expect to meet the requirements under these arrangements based on our current and anticipated level of operations. Legal Proceedings Litigation Relating to the SolarCity Acquisition Between September 1, 2016 and October 5, 2016, seven lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery by purported stockholders of Tesla challenging our acquisition of SolarCity Corporation (“SolarCity”). Following consolidation, the lawsuit names as defendants the members of Tesla’s board of directors as then constituted and alleges, among other things, that board members breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the acquisition. The complaint asserts both derivative claims and direct claims on behalf of a purported class and seeks, among other relief, unspecified monetary damages, attorneys’ fees and costs. On January 22, 2020, all of the director defendants except Elon Musk reached a settlement to resolve the lawsuit against them for an amount to be paid entirely under the applicable insurance policy. The settlement, which does not involve an admission of any wrongdoing by any party, was approved by the Court on August 17, 2020. Tesla received payment of approximately $ 43 million on September 16, 2020, which has been recognized in our consolidated statements of operations as a reduction to Selling, general and administrative operating expenses for costs previously incurred related to the acquisition of SolarCity. The trial was held from July 12 to July 23, 2021 and on August 16, 2021. On October 22, 2021, the Court approved the parties’ joint stipulation that (a) the class is decertified and the action shall continue exclusively as a derivative action under Court of Chancery Rule 23.1 and (b) the direct claims against Elon Musk are dismissed with prejudice. Following post-trial briefing, post-trial argument was held on January 18, 2022. On April 27, 2022, the Court entered judgment in favor of Mr. Musk on all counts. On May 26, 2022, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal. Oral argument was held before the Supreme Court of Delaware on March 29, 2023, and on June 6, 2023, the Supreme Court of Delaware affirmed the Court of Chancery’s decision. 18 These plaintiffs and others filed parallel actions in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on or about April 21, 2017. They include claims for violations of the federal securities laws and breach of fiduciary duties by Tesla’s board of directors. Those actions have been consolidated and stayed pending the above-referenced Chancery Court litigation. Litigation Relating to 2018 CEO Performance Award On June 4, 2018, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a putative class and derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Elon Musk and the members of Tesla’s board of directors as then constituted, alleging corporate waste, unjust enrichment and that such board members breached their fiduciary duties by approving the stock-based compensation plan awarded to Elon Musk in 2018. The complaint seeks, among other things, monetary damages and rescission or reformation of the stock-based compensation plan. On August 31, 2018, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint; plaintiff filed its opposition brief on November 1, 2018; and defendants filed a reply brief on December 13, 2018. The hearing on the motion to dismiss was held on May 9, 2019. On September 20, 2019, the Court granted the motion to dismiss as to the corporate waste claim but denied the motion as to the breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims. Defendants’ answer was filed on December 3, 2019. On January 25, 2021, the Court conditionally certified certain claims and a class of Tesla stockholders as a class action. On September 30, 2021, plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file a verified amended derivative complaint. On October 1, 2021, defendants Kimbal Musk and Steve Jurvetson moved for summary judgment as to the claims against them. Following the motion, plaintiff agreed to voluntarily dismiss the claims against Kimbal Musk and Steve Jurvetson. Plaintiff also moved for summary judgment on October 1, 2021. On October 27, 2021, the Court approved the parties’ joint stipulation that, among other things, (a) all claims against Kimbal Musk and Steve Jurvetson in the Complaint are dismissed with prejudice; (b) the class is decertified and the action shall continue exclusively as a derivative action under Court of Chancery Rule 23.1; and (c) the direct claims against the remaining defendants are dismissed with prejudice. On November 18, 2021, the remaining defendants (a) moved for partial summary judgment, (b) opposed plaintiff’s summary judgment motion and (c) opposed the plaintiff’s motion to amend his complaint. In January 2022, the case was assigned to a different judge. On February 24, 2022, the court (i) granted plaintiff’s motion to amend his complaint, and (ii) canceled oral argument on the summary judgment motions, stating that the court is “skeptical that this litigation can be resolved based on the undisputed facts” and the “case is going to trial,” but that the “parties may reassert their arguments made in support of summary judgment in their pre-trial and post-trial briefs.” Trial was held November 14-18, 2022. Post-trial briefing and argument are now complete. Litigation Related to Directors’ Compensation On June 17, 2020, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla’s current and former directors regarding compensation awards granted to Tesla’s directors, other than Elon Musk, between 2017 and 2020. The suit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages and other relief. Defendants filed their answer on September 17, 2020. Trial is currently set for November 27, 2023, to December 1, 2023. On July 14, 2023, the parties filed a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise and Settlement, which does not involve an admission of any wrongdoing by any party. If the settlement is approved by the Court, this action will be fully settled and dismissed with prejudice. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Tesla will provide notice of the proposed settlement to stockholders of record as of July 14, 2023. The Court will hold a hearing regarding the settlement on October 13, 2023. The general terms, conditions and timing of this proposed settlement are further set forth in the Form 8-K filed on July 20, 2023, which includes, among other things, the court-approved notice of the proposed settlement. The settlement is not expected to have an adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Litigation Relating to Potential Going Private Transaction Between August 10, 2018 and September 6, 2018, nine purported stockholder class actions were filed against Tesla and Elon Musk in connection with Mr. Musk’s August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. On January 16, 2019, Plaintiffs filed their consolidated complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and added as defendants the members of Tesla’s board of directors. The consolidated complaint asserts claims for violations of the federal securities laws and seeks unspecified damages and other relief. The parties stipulated to certification of a class of stockholders, which the court granted on November 25, 2020. Trial started on January 17, 2023, and on February 3, 2023, a jury rendered a verdict in favor of the defendants on all counts. After trial, plaintiffs filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law and a motion for new trial, which the Court denied and judgement was entered in favor of defendants on July 11, 2023. 19 Between October 17, 2018 and March 8, 2021, seven derivative lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of Tesla’s board of directors, as constituted at relevant times, in relation to statements made and actions connected to a potential going private transaction, with certain of the lawsuits challenging additional Twitter posts by Mr. Musk, among other things. Five of those actions were consolidated, and all seven actions have been stayed pending resolution of the above-referenced consolidated purported stockholder class action. In addition to these cases, two derivative lawsuits were filed on October 25, 2018 and February 11, 2019 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of the Tesla board of directors as then constituted. Those cases have also been consolidated and stayed pending the entry of judgment in the above-referenced consolidated purported stockholder class action. On October 21, 2022, a lawsuit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery by a purported shareholder of Tesla alleging, among other things, that board members breached their fiduciary duties in connection with their oversight of the Company’s 2018 settlement with the SEC, as amended. Among other things, the plaintiff seeks reforms to the Company’s corporate governance and internal procedures, unspecified damages, and attorneys’ fees. The parties reached an agreement to stay the case until September 5, 2023. On November 15, 2021, JPMorgan Chase Bank (“JP Morgan”) filed a lawsuit against Tesla in the Southern District of New York alleging breach of a stock warrant agreement that was entered into as part of a convertible notes offering in 2014. In 2018, JP Morgan informed Tesla that it had adjusted the strike price based upon Mr. Musk’s August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. Tesla disputed JP Morgan’s adjustment as a violation of the parties’ agreement. In 2021, Tesla delivered shares to JP Morgan per the agreement, which they duly accepted. JP Morgan now alleges that it is owed approximately $ 162 million as the value of additional shares that it claims should have been delivered as a result of the adjustment to the strike price in 2018. On January 24, 2022, Tesla filed multiple counterclaims as part of its answer to the underlying lawsuit, asserting among other points that JP Morgan should have terminated the stock warrant agreement in 2018 rather than make an adjustment to the strike price that it should have known would lead to a commercially unreasonable result. Tesla believes that the adjustments made by JP Morgan were neither proper nor commercially reasonable, as required under the stock warrant agreements. JP Morgan filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, which Tesla opposed, and that motion is currently pending before the Court. Litigation and Investigations Relating to Alleged Discrimination and Harassment On October 4, 2021, in a case captioned Diaz v. Tesla , a jury in the Northern District of California returned a verdict against Tesla on claims by a former contingent worker that he was subjected to race discrimination while assigned to work at Tesla’s Fremont Factory from 2015-2016. On November 16, 2021, Tesla filed a post-trial motion for relief that included a request for a new trial or reduction of the jury’s damages. On April 13, 2022, the Court granted Tesla’s motion in part, reducing the total damages and conditionally denied the motion for a new trial subject to the plaintiff’s acceptance of the reduced award. On June 21, 2022, the plaintiff rejected the reduced award and, as a result, on June 27, 2022, the Court ordered a new trial on damages only, which commenced on March 27, 2023, after which a jury returned a verdict of $ 3,175,000 . As a result, the damages awarded against Tesla were reduced from an initial $ 136.9 million (October 4, 2021) down to $ 15 million (April 13, 2022), and then further down to $ 3.175 million (April 3, 2023). On February 9, 2022, shortly after the first Diaz jury verdict, the California Civil Rights Department (”CRD,” formerly “DFEH”) filed a civil complaint against Tesla in Alameda County, California Superior Court, alleging systemic race discrimination, hostile work environment and pay equity claims, among others. CRD’s amended complaint seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief. On September 22, 2022, Tesla filed a cross complaint against CRD, alleging that it violated the Administrative Procedures Act by failing to follow statutory pre-requisites prior to filing suit and that cross complaint was subject to a sustained demurrer, which Tesla later amended and refiled. The case is now in discovery. Additionally, on June 1, 2022 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) issued a cause finding against Tesla that closely parallels the CRD’s allegations. Tesla engaged in a mandatory mediation with the EEOC in June 2023, which did not result in a resolution. On June 16, 2022, two Tesla stockholders filed separate derivative actions in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla’s current and former directors. Both suits assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and violation of the federal securities laws in connection with alleged race and gender discrimination and sexual harassment. Among other things, plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages payable to Tesla, and attorneys’ fees. On July 22, 2022, the Court consolidated the two cases and on September 6, 2022, plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. On November 7, 2022, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the case. Plaintiffs filed a response of January 13, 2023, and the defendants replied on February 17, 2023. 20 Other Litigation Related to Our Products and Services We are also subject to various lawsuits, including proposed class actions, that seek monetary and other injunctive relief. For example, on September 14, 2022, a proposed class action was filed against Tesla, Inc. and related entities in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging various claims about the Company’s driver assistance technology systems under state and federal law. This case was later consolidated with several other proposed class actions, and a Consolidated Amended Complaint was filed on October 28, 2022, which seeks damages and other relief on behalf of all persons who purchased or leased from Tesla between January 1, 2016 to the present. On October 5, 2022 a proposed class action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York asserting similar state and federal law claims against the same defendants. On March 22, 2023, the plaintiffs in the California consolidated action filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to order Tesla to (1) cease using the term “Full Self-Driving Capability” (FSDC), (2) cease the sale and activation of FSDC and deactivate FSDC on Tesla vehicles, and (3) provide certain notices to consumers about proposed court-findings about the accuracy of the use of the terms Autopilot and FSDC. Tesla opposed the motion. On February 27, 2023, a proposed class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against Tesla, Inc., Elon Musk and certain current and former Company executives. The complaint alleges that the defendants made material misrepresentations and omissions about the Company’s Autopilot and FSDC technologies and seeks money damages and other relief on behalf of persons who purchased Tesla stock between February 19, 2019 and February 17, 2023. On April 13, 2023, a putative Tesla shareholder filed a related shareholder derivative complaint against the members of Tesla’s board of directors and certain current and former executives, alleging contribution for violations of the federal securities law, breach of fiduciary duties, waste, and unjust enrichment. The complaint asserts derivative claims and seeks, among other relief, unspecified monetary damages, attorneys’ fees and costs. On March 14, 2023 a proposed class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Several similar complaints have also been filed in the same court and these cases have now all been consolidated. These complaints allege that Tesla violates federal antitrust and warranty laws through its repair, service, and maintenance practices and seeks, among other relief, damages for persons who paid Tesla for repairs services or Tesla compatible replacement parts from March 2019 to March 2023. On July 17, 2023, these plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself in these matters; however, we cannot predict the outcome or impact. We are unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these claims, unless noted. Certain Investigations and Other Matters We receive requests for information from regulators and governmental authorities, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board, the SEC, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and various state, federal, and international agencies. We routinely cooperate with such regulatory and governmental requests, including subpoenas, formal and informal requests and other investigations and inquiries. For example, the SEC had issued subpoenas to Tesla in connection with Elon Musk’s prior statement that he was considering taking Tesla private. The take-private investigation was resolved and closed with a settlement entered into with the SEC in September 2018 and as further clarified in April 2019 in an amendment. The SEC also has periodically issued subpoenas to us seeking information on our governance processes around compliance with the SEC settlement, as amended. Separately, the company has received requests from the DOJ for documents related to Tesla’s Autopilot and FSD features. To our knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. We cannot predict the outcome or impact of any ongoing matters. Should the government decide to pursue an enforcement action, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation, prospects, cash flows and financial position. We are also subject to various other legal proceedings, risks and claims that arise from the normal course of business activities. For example, during the second quarter of 2023, a foreign news outlet reported that it obtained certain misappropriated data including, purportedly, among other things, non-public Tesla business and personal information. While Tesla’s investigation remains ongoing, we are working with certain law enforcement and other authorities. If an unfavorable ruling or development were to occur in this or other possible legal proceedings, risks and claims, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position or brand. 21 Note 10 – Variable Interest Entity Arrangements The aggregate carrying values of the variable interest entities’ assets and liabilities, after elimination of any intercompany transactions and balances, in the consolidated balance sheets were as follows (in millions): June 30, December 31, 2023 2022 Assets Current assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 74 $ 68 Accounts receivable, net 40 22 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 223 274 Total current assets 337 364 Solar energy systems, net 3,969 4,060 Other non-current assets 394 404 Total assets $ 4,700 $ 4,828 Liabilities Current liabilities Accrued liabilities and other $ 68 $ 69 Deferred revenue 9 10 Current portion of debt and finance leases 975 1,013 Total current liabilities 1,052 1,092 Deferred revenue, net of current portion 147 149 Debt and finance leases, net of current portion 485 971 Other long-term liabilities 2 3 Total liabilities $ 1,686 $ 2,215 22 Note 11 – Segment Reporting and Information about Geographic Areas We have two operating and reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Overview Our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. We design, develop, manufacture, lease and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles, solar energy generation systems and energy storage products. We also offer maintenance, installation, operation, financial and other services related to our products. Additionally, we are increasingly focused on products and services based on artificial intelligence, robotics and automation. In 2023, we produced 920,508 consumer vehicles and delivered 889,015 consumer vehicles through the second quarter. We are currently focused on increasing vehicle production, capacity and delivery capabilities, reducing costs, improving and developing our vehicles and battery technologies, improving and further deploying our FSD capabilities, increasing the affordability and efficiency of our vehicles, bringing new products to market and expanding our global infrastructure. In 2023, we deployed 7.54 GWh of energy storage products and 133 megawatts of solar energy systems through the second quarter. We are currently focused on ramping production of energy storage products, improving our Solar Roof installation capability and efficiency, and increasing market share of retrofit solar energy systems. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, we recognized total revenues of $24.93 billion and $48.26 billion, respectively, representing increases of $7.99 billion and $12.57 billion, respectively, over the same periods ended June 30, 2022. We continue to ramp production, build new manufacturing capacity, invest in research and development and expand our operations to enable increased deliveries and deployments of our products and further revenue growth. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, our net income attributable to common stockholders was $2.70 billion and $5.22 billion, respectively, representing a favorable change of $444 million and an unfavorable change of $361 million, respectively, over the same periods ended June 30, 2022. We continue to focus on improving our profitability through production and operational efficiencies. We ended the second quarter of 2023 with $23.08 billion in cash and cash equivalents and investments, representing an increase of $890 million from the end of 2022. Our cash flows provided by operating activities during the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 were $5.58 billion and $6.35 billion, respectively, representing a decrease of $768 million. Capital expenditures amounted to $4.13 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to $3.50 billion during the same period ended June 30, 2022. Sustained growth has allowed our business to generally fund itself, and we will continue investing in a number of capital-intensive projects in upcoming periods. Management Opportunities, Challenges and Uncertainties and 2023 Outlook Automotive—Production The following is a summary of the status of production of each of our announced vehicle models in production and under development, as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q: Production Location Vehicle Model(s) Production Status Fremont Factory Model S / Model X Active Model 3 / Model Y Active Gigafactory Shanghai Model 3 / Model Y Active Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg Model Y Active Gigafactory Texas Model Y Active Cybertruck Tooling Gigafactory Nevada Tesla Semi Pilot production Various Next Generation Platform In development TBD Tesla Roadster In development 24 We are focused on growing our manufacturing capacity, which includes capacity for manufacturing new vehicle models such as our Cybertruck and next generation platform, and ramping all of our production vehicles to their installed production capacities as well as increasing production rate and efficiency at our current factories. The next phase of production growth will depend on the ramp at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas, as well as our ability to add to our available sources of battery cell supply by manufacturing our own cells that we are developing to have high-volume output, lower capital and production costs and longer range. Our goals are to improve vehicle performance, decrease production costs and increase affordability and customer awareness. These plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations, which may be exacerbated by new product and manufacturing technologies we introduce, the number of concurrent international projects, any industry-wide component constraints, labor shortages and any future impact from events outside of our control. Moreover, we have set ambitious technological targets with our plans for battery cells as well as for iterative manufacturing and design improvements for our vehicles with each new factory. Automotive—Demand, Sales, Deliveries and Infrastructure Our cost reduction efforts, cost innovation strategies, and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our vehicles’ affordability and have allowed us to competitively price our vehicles. We will also continue to generate demand and brand awareness by improving our vehicles’ performance and functionality, including through products based on artificial intelligence such as Autopilot and FSD, and other software features, and delivering new vehicles, such as our upcoming Cybertruck. Moreover, we expect to continue to benefit from ongoing electrification of the automotive sector and increasing environmental regulations and initiatives. However, we operate in a cyclical industry that is sensitive to political and regulatory uncertainty, including with respect to trade and the environment, all of which can be compounded by inflationary pressures, rising energy prices, increases in interest rates and the liquidity of enterprise customers. For example, inflationary pressures have increased across the markets in which we operate. In an effort to curb this trend, central banks in developed countries raised interest rates rapidly and substantially, impacting the affordability of vehicle lease and finance arrangements. Further, sales of vehicles in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to increased volatility as we expand and adjust our operations. Moreover, as additional competitors enter the marketplace and help bring the world closer to sustainable transportation, we will have to adjust and continue to execute well to maintain our momentum. These macroeconomic and industry trends have had, and will likely continue to have, an impact on the pricing of, and order rate for our vehicles, and in turn our operating margin. We will continue to adjust accordingly to such developments, and we believe our ongoing cost reduction, including improved production innovation and efficiency at our newest factories and lower logistics costs, and focus on operating leverage will continue to benefit us in relation to our competitors, while our new products will help enable future growth. As our production increases, we must work constantly to similarly increase vehicle delivery capability so that it does not become a bottleneck on our total deliveries. We are also committed to reducing the percentage of vehicles delivered in the third month of each quarter, which will help to reduce the cost per vehicle. As we expand our manufacturing operations globally, we will also have to continue to increase and staff our delivery, servicing and charging infrastructure accordingly, maintain our vehicle reliability and optimize our Supercharger locations to ensure cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction. In particular, as other automotive manufacturers have announced their adoption of the North American Charging Standard (“NACS”) and agreements with us to utilize our Superchargers, we must correspondingly expand our network in order to ensure adequate availability to meet customer demands. We also remain focused on continued enhancements of the capability and efficiency of our servicing operations. Energy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment The long-term success of this business is dependent upon increasing margins through greater volumes. We continue to increase the production of our energy storage products to meet high levels of demand, including the announcement of a new Megafactory in Shanghai. For Megapack, energy storage deployments can vary meaningfully quarter to quarter depending on the timing of specific project milestones. For Powerwall, better availability and growing concerns over grid stability drive higher customer interest. We remain committed to growing our retrofit solar energy business by offering a low-cost and simplified online ordering experience. In addition, we continue to seek to improve our installation capabilities and price efficiencies for Solar Roof. As these product lines grow, we will have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage products and ensure the availability of qualified personnel, particularly skilled electricians, to support the ramp of Solar Roof. 25 Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends Our capital expenditures are typically difficult to project beyond the short-term given the number and breadth of our core projects at any given time, and may further be impacted by uncertainties in future global market conditions. We are simultaneously ramping new products, building or ramping manufacturing facilities on three continents, piloting the development and manufacture of new battery cell technologies, expanding our Supercharger network and investing in autonomy and other artificial intelligence enabled training and products, and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending on overall priority among projects, the pace at which we meet milestones, production adjustments to and among our various products, increased capital efficiencies and the addition of new projects. Owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced projects under development, all other continuing infrastructure growth and varying levels of inflation, we currently expect our capital expenditures to be between $7.00 to $9.00 billion in 2023 and in each of the following two fiscal years. Our business has recently been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend, and with better working capital management resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding, our sales growth is also facilitating positive cash generation. We have and will continue to utilize such cash flows, among other things, to do more vertical integration, expand our product roadmap and provide financing options to our customers. At the same time, we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods depending on the specific pace of our capital-intensive projects and other potential variables such as rising material prices and increases in supply chain and labor expenses resulting from changes in global trade conditions and labor availability. Overall, we expect our ability to be self-funding to continue as long as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates For a description of our critical accounting policies and estimates, refer to Part II, Item 7, Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Results of Operations Revenues Three Months Ended June 30, Change Six Months Ended June 30, Change (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 $ % 2023 2022 $ % Automotive sales $ 20,419 $ 13,670 $ 6,749 49 % $ 39,297 $ 29,184 $ 10,113 35 % Automotive regulatory credits 282 344 (62 ) (18 )% 803 1,023 (220 ) (22 )% Automotive leasing 567 588 (21 ) (4 )% 1,131 1,256 (125 ) (10 )% Total automotive revenues 21,268 14,602 6,666 46 % 41,231 31,463 9,768 31 % Services and other 2,150 1,466 684 47 % 3,987 2,745 1,242 45 % Total automotive & services and other segment revenue 23,418 16,068 7,350 46 % 45,218 34,208 11,010 32 % Energy generation and storage segment revenue 1,509 866 643 74 % 3,038 1,482 1,556 105 % Total revenues $ 24,927 $ 16,934 $ 7,993 47 % $ 48,256 $ 35,690 $ 12,566 35 % 26 Automotive & Services and Other Segment Automotive sales revenue increased $6.75 billion, or 49%, in the three months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022, primarily due to increases of 196,382 combined Model 3 and Model Y cash deliveries and 3,395 combined Model S and Model X cash deliveries year over year despite a negative impact from the United States dollar strengthening against other foreign currencies in the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the prior period. This was achieved from production ramping of Model Y globally. The increases were partially offset by lower average selling price on our vehicles driven by overall price reductions year over year. Automotive sales revenue increased $10.11 billion, or 35%, in the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily due to an increase of 304,760 combined Model 3 and Model Y cash deliveries year over year despite a negative impact from the United States dollar strengthening against other foreign currencies in the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the prior period. This was achieved from production ramping and partially offset by lower average selling price on our vehicles as mentioned above. Automotive regulatory credits revenue decreased $62 million, or 18%, in the three months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022. Automotive regulatory credits revenue decreased $220 million, or 22%, in the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily due to the recognition of $288 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2022 primarily due to changes in regulation which entitled us to additional consideration for credits sold previously. Automotive leasing revenue decreased $21 million, or 4%, in the three months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022. Automotive leasing revenue decreased $125 million, or 10%, in the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022. The decreases were primarily due to a decrease in direct sales-type leasing revenue driven by lower deliveries year over year, partially offset by an increase from our growing direct operating lease portfolio. Services and other revenue increased $684 million, or 47%, in the three months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022. Services and other revenue increased $1.24 billion, or 45%, in the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022. The increases were primarily due to an increase in used vehicle revenue driven by increases in volume, non-warranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continues to grow, paid Supercharging revenue, insurance services revenue and retail merchandise revenue, partially offset by decreases in average selling price of used Tesla and non-Tesla vehicles. Energy Generation and Storage Segment Energy generation and storage revenue increased $643 million, or 74%, in the three months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022. Energy generation and storage revenue increased $1.56 billion, or 105%, in the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022. The increases were primarily due to an increase in deployments of Megapack at a lower average selling price. 27 Cost of Revenues and Gross Margin Three Months Ended June 30, Change Six Months Ended June 30, Change (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 $ % 2023 2022 $ % Cost of revenues Automotive sales $ 16,841 $ 10,153 $ 6,688 66 % $ 32,263 $ 21,067 $ 11,196 53 % Automotive leasing 338 368 (30 ) (8 )% 671 776 (105 ) (14 )% Total automotive cost of revenues 17,179 10,521 6,658 63 % 32,934 21,843 11,091 51 % Services and other 1,984 1,410 574 41 % 3,686 2,696 990 37 % Total automotive & services and other segment cost of revenues 19,163 11,931 7,232 61 % 36,620 24,539 12,081 49 % Energy generation and storage segment 1,231 769 462 60 % 2,592 1,457 1,135 78 % Total cost of revenues $ 20,394 $ 12,700 $ 7,694 61 % $ 39,212 $ 25,996 $ 13,216 51 % Gross profit total automotive $ 4,089 $ 4,081 $ 8,297 $ 9,620 Gross margin total automotive 19.2 % 27.9 % 20.1 % 30.6 % Gross profit total automotive & services and other segment $ 4,255 $ 4,137 $ 8,598 $ 9,669 Gross margin total automotive & services and other segment 18.2 % 25.7 % 19.0 % 28.3 % Gross profit energy generation and storage segment $ 278 $ 97 $ 446 $ 25 Gross margin energy generation and storage segment 18.4 % 11.2 % 14.7 % 1.7 % Total gross profit $ 4,533 $ 4,234 $ 9,044 $ 9,694 Total gross margin 18.2 % 25.0 % 18.7 % 27.2 % Automotive & Services and Other Segment Cost of automotive sales revenue increased $6.69 billion, or 66%, in the three months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022. Cost of automotive sales revenue increased $11.20 billion, or 53%, in the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022. Cost of automotive sales revenue increased in line with the growth in deliveries year over year, as discussed above. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in the average combined cost per unit of our vehicles primarily due to decrease in material costs, lower manufacturing costs from better fixed cost absorption offset by higher outbound freight and duties. Our costs of revenue were also positively impacted by the IRA manufacturing credits earned during the current periods and by the United States dollar strengthening against our foreign currencies as compared to the prior periods. Cost of automotive leasing revenue decreased $30 million, or 8%, in the three months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022. Cost of automotive leasing revenue decreased $105 million, or 14%, in the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022. The decreases were primarily due to a decrease in direct sales-type leasing cost of revenue driven by lower deliveries year over year. Cost of services and other revenue increased $574 million, or 41%, in the three months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022. Cost of services and other revenue increased $990 million, or 37%, in the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022. The increases were in line with the changes in services and other revenue as discussed above. Gross margin for total automotive decreased from 27.9% to 19.2% in the three months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022. Gross margin for total automotive decreased from 30.6% to 20.1% in the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022. The decreases were primarily due to lower average selling price on our vehicles, margin headwinds from underutilization of new factories, and a decrease in regulatory credits revenue, partially offset by the overall favorable change in our average combined cost per unit of our vehicles as discussed above. Gross margin for total automotive & services and other segment decreased from 25.7% to 18.2% in the three months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022. Gross margin for total automotive & services and other segment decreased from 28.3% to 19.0% in the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily due to the automotive gross margin decrease discussed above, partially offset by an improvement in our services and other gross margin. Additionally, there was a higher proportion of services and other, which operated at a lower gross margin, within the segment during the first half of 2023 as compared to the prior year. 28 Energy Generation and Storage Segment Cost of energy generation and storage revenue increased $462 million, or 60%, in the three months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022. Cost of energy generation and storage revenue increased $1.14 billion, or 78%, in the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022, in line with the changes in Megapack deployments year over year, as discussed above. These increases were partially offset by improvements in production ramping that drove down the average cost per MWh of Megapack. Gross margin for energy generation and storage improved from 11.2% to 18.4% in the three months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022. Gross margin for energy generation and storage improved from 1.7% to 14.7% in the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022. The increases were driven by the changes in Megapack revenue and cost per MWh as described above. Research and Development Expense Three Months Ended June 30, Change Six Months Ended June 30, Change (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 $ % 2023 2022 $ % Research and development $ 943 $ 667 $ 276 41 % $ 1,714 $ 1,532 $ 182 12 % As a percentage of revenues 4 % 4 % 4 % 4 % Research and development (“R&D”) expenses increased $276 million, or 41%, in the three months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022. R&D expenses increased $182 million, or 12%, in the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022. The overall increases were primarily driven by additional costs in the current period related to the pre-production phase for Cybertruck, AI and other programs. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue stayed consistent at 4% in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in the prior year. Our R&D expenses have increased proportionately with total revenues as we continue to expand our product roadmap and technologies. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Three Months Ended June 30, Change Six Months Ended June 30, Change (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 $ % 2023 2022 $ % Selling, general and administrative $ 1,191 $ 961 $ 230 24 % $ 2,267 $ 1,953 $ 314 16 % As a percentage of revenues 5 % 6 % 5 % 5 % Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses increased $230 million, or 24%, in the three months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022. This was driven by a $135 million increase in employee and labor costs primarily from increased headcount, including professional services and an $81 million increase in facilities related expenses. SG&A expenses increased $314 million, or 16%, in the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022. This was driven by a $183 million increase in employee and labor costs primarily from increased headcount, including professional services and a $166 million increase in facilities related expenses. The increases were partially offset by a decrease of $52 million in stock-based compensation expense, primarily attributable to the lower stock-based compensation expense on the 2018 CEO Performance Award which was fully expensed as of December 31, 2022. Restructuring and Other Three Months Ended June 30, Change Six Months Ended June 30, Change (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 $ % 2023 2022 $ % Restructuring and other $ — $ 142 $ (142 ) (100 )% $ — $ 142 $ (142 ) (100 )% During the three months ended June 30, 2022, we recorded impairment loss of $170 million as well as realized gains of $64 million in connection with converting our holdings of digital assets into fiat currency. We also recorded other expenses of $36 million related to employee terminations during the three months ended June 30, 2022. 29 Interest Income Three Months Ended June 30, Change Six Months Ended June 30, Change (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 $ % 2023 2022 $ % Interest income $ 238 $ 26 $ 212 815 % $ 451 $ 54 $ 397 735 % Interest income increased $212 million, or 815%, in the three months ended June 30, 2023 and increased $397 million, or 735%, in the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively. This increase was primarily due to higher interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the prior periods. This was driven by an increase in our short-term investments balance and rising interest rates. Other (Expense) Income, Net Three Months Ended June 30, Change Six Months Ended June 30, Change (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 $ % 2023 2022 $ % Other income, net $ 328 $ 28 $ 300 1071 % $ 280 $ 84 $ 196 233 % Other income, net, changed favorably by $300 million in the three months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022. Other income, net, changed favorably by $196 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022. The favorable changes were primarily due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our intercompany balances. Provision for Income Taxes Three Months Ended June 30, Change Six Months Ended June 30, Change (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 $ % 2023 2022 $ % Provision for income taxes $ 323 $ 205 $ 118 58 % $ 584 $ 551 $ 33 6 % Effective tax rate 11 % 8 % 10 % 9 % Our provision for income taxes increased by $118 million, or 58%, in the three months ended June 30, 2023 and increased by $33 million, or 6%, in the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022 and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, primarily due to the change in our pre-tax income year over year and changes in mix of jurisdictional earnings. Our effective tax rate increased from 8% to 11% in the three months ended June 30, 2023 and increased from 9% to 10% in the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, primarily due to changes in mix of jurisdictional earnings. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details. 30 Liquidity and Capital Resources We expect to continue to generate net positive operating cash flow as we have done in the last four fiscal years. The cash we generate from our core operations enables us to fund ongoing operations and production, our research and development projects for new products and technologies including our proprietary battery cells, additional manufacturing ramps at existing manufacturing facilities such as the Fremont Factory, Gigafactory Nevada, Gigafactory Shanghai and Gigafactory New York, the ramp of Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas, the construction of future factories, and the continued expansion of our retail and service locations, body shops, Mobile Service fleet, Supercharger, including to support NACS, energy product installation capabilities and autonomy and other artificial intelligence enabled products. In addition, because a large portion of our future expenditures will be to fund our growth, we expect that if needed we will be able to adjust our capital and operating expenditures by operating segment. For example, if our near-term manufacturing operations decrease in scale or ramp more slowly than expected, including due to global economic or business conditions, we may choose to correspondingly slow the pace of our capital expenditures. Finally, we continually evaluate our cash needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital or seek alternative financing sources to fund the rapid growth of our business, including through drawdowns on existing or new debt facilities or financing funds. Conversely, we may also from time to time determine that it is in our best interests to voluntarily repay certain indebtedness early. Accordingly, we believe that our current sources of funds will provide us with adequate liquidity during the 12-month period following June 30, 2023, as well as in the long-term. See the sections below for more details regarding the material requirements for cash in our business and our sources of liquidity to meet such needs. Material Cash Requirements From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with vendors for the purchase of components and raw materials to be used in the manufacture of our products. However, due to contractual terms, variability in the precise growth curves of our development and production ramps, and opportunities to renegotiate pricing, we generally do not have binding and enforceable purchase orders under such contracts beyond the short-term, and the timing and magnitude of purchase orders beyond such period is difficult to accurately project. As discussed in and subject to the considerations referenced in Part I, Item 2, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Management Opportunities, Challenges and Uncertainties and 2023 Outlook—Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we currently expect our capital expenditures to support our projects globally to be between $7.00 to $9.00 billion in 2023 and in each of the following two fiscal years. We also have certain obligations in connection with our operations at Gigafactory New York and Gigafactory Shanghai, as outlined in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Material Cash Requirements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. As of June 30, 2023, we and our subsidiaries had outstanding $1.53 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness, of which $1.02 billion is scheduled to become due in the succeeding 12 months. For details regarding our indebtedness, refer to Note 7, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Sources and Conditions of Liquidity Our sources to fund our material cash requirements are predominantly from our deliveries and servicing of new and used vehicles, sales and installations of our energy storage products and solar energy systems, proceeds from debt facilities and proceeds from equity offerings, when applicable. As of June 30, 2023, we had $15.30 billion and $7.78 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, respectively. Balances held in foreign currencies had a U.S. dollar equivalent of $3.85 billion and consisted primarily of Chinese yuan, euros and Canadian dollar. We had $5.16 billion of unused committed amounts under our credit facilities as of June 30, 2023. Certain of such unused committed amounts are subject to satisfying specified conditions prior to draw-down (such as pledging to leased vehicles and our interests in those leases). For details regarding our indebtedness, refer to Note 7 , Debt , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We continue adapting our strategy to meet our liquidity and risk objectives, such as investing in U.S. government and other investments, to do more vertical integration, expand our product roadmap and provide financing options to our customers. 31 Summary of Cash Flows Six Months Ended June 30, (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 5,578 $ 6,346 Net cash used in investing activities $ (6,018 ) $ (3,051 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (561 ) $ (2,320 ) Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $768 million to $5.58 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2023 from $6.35 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2022. This decrease was primarily due to unfavorable changes in net operating assets and liabilities of $683 million and the decrease in net income excluding non-cash expenses, gains and losses of $85 million. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Cash flows from investing activities and their variability across each period related primarily to capital expenditures, which were $4.13 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and $3.50 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2022, mainly for the expansions of Gigafactory Texas, Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg, Gigafactory Shanghai and the Fremont Factory. We also purchased $1.81 billion and $476 million of investments, net of proceeds from maturities and sales, for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities decreased by $1.76 billion to $561 million during the six months ended June 30, 2023 from $2.32 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a $1.68 billion decrease in repayments of convertible and other debt. See Note 7, Debt , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details regarding our debt obligations. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Risk We transact business globally in multiple currencies and hence have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, costs of revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (primarily the Chinese yuan, euro, Canadian dollar and Australian dollar in relation to our current year operations). In general, we are a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar for our foreign subsidiaries. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars as we do not typically hedge foreign currency risk. We have also experienced, and will continue to experience, fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local currency (primarily consisting of our intercompany and cash and cash equivalents balances). We considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is reasonably possible that adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near-term. These changes were applied to our total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our local currencies at the balance sheet date to compute the impact these changes would have had on our net income before income taxes. These changes would have resulted in a gain or loss of $694 million at June 30, 2023 and $473 million at December 31, 2022, assuming no foreign currency hedging. 32 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of June 30, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were designed at a reasonable assurance level and were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2023, which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS For a description of our material pending legal proceedings, please see Note 9, Commitments and Contingencies , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, each of the matters below is being disclosed pursuant to Item 103 of Regulation S-K because it relates to environmental regulations and aggregate civil penalties that we currently believe could potentially exceed $1 million. We believe that any proceeding that is material to our business or financial condition is likely to have potential penalties far in excess of such amount. District attorneys in certain California counties conducted an investigation into Tesla’s waste segregation practices pursuant to Cal. Health & Saf. Code section 25100 et seq. and Cal. Civil Code § 1798.80. Tesla has implemented various remedial measures, including conducting training and audits, and enhancements to its site waste management programs. While the outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time, it is not currently expected to have a material adverse impact on our business. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, which could adversely affect our business, financial conditions and future results. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS None. ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES None. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable. ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION None of the Company’s directors or officers adopted , modified or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement during the Company’s fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2023, as such terms are defined under Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K. 33 ITEM 6.

The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. The interim consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the annual consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. The interim consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes have been prepared on the same basis as the annual consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations for the periods presented. The consolidated results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or for any other future years or interim periods. Reclassifications Certain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation in the accompanying notes. Revenue Recognition Revenue by source The following table disaggregates our revenue by major source (in millions): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Automotive sales $ 18,582 $ 17,785 $ 57,879 $ 46,969 Automotive regulatory credits 554 286 1,357 1,309 Energy generation and storage sales 1,416 966 4,188 2,186 Services and other 2,166 1,645 6,153 4,390 Total revenues from sales and services 22,718 20,682 69,577 54,854 Automotive leasing 489 621 1,620 1,877 Energy generation and storage leasing 143 151 409 413 Total revenues $ 23,350 $ 21,454 $ 71,606 $ 57,144 Automotive Segment Automotive Sales Revenue Deferred revenue is related to the access to our Full Self Driving (“FSD”) features and ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air software updates primarily on automotive sales, which amounted to $ 3.27 billion and $ 2.91 billion as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Deferred revenue is equivalent to the total transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, as of the balance sheet date. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 360 million and $ 169 million for nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Of the total deferred revenue balance as of September 30, 2023, we expect to recognize $ 815 million of revenue in the next 12 months. The remaining balance will be recognized at the time of transfer of control of the product or over the performance period. 10 Table of Contents We have been providing loans for financing our automotive deliveries in volume since fiscal year 2022. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we have recorded net financing receivables on the consolidated balance sheets, of which $ 239 million and $ 128 million, respectively, is recorded within Accounts receivable, net, for the current portion and $ 1.11 billion and $ 665 million, respectively, is recorded within Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. Automotive Regulatory Credits During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we had also recognized $ 288 million in revenue due to changes in regulation which entitled us to additional consideration for credits sold previously. Automotive Leasing Revenue Direct Sales-Type Leasing Program For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized $ 20 million and $ 197 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing revenue and $ 16 million and $ 149 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing cost of revenue. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, we recognized $ 161 million and $ 559 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing revenue and $ 97 million and $ 343 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing cost of revenue. Lease receivables relating to sales-type leases are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as follows (in millions): September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Gross lease receivables $ 803 $ 837 Unearned interest income ( 84 ) ( 95 ) Allowance for expected credit losses ( 6 ) ( 4 ) Net investment in sales-type leases $ 713 $ 738 Reported as: Prepaid expenses and other current assets $ 178 $ 164 Other non-current assets 535 574 Net investment in sales-type leases $ 713 $ 738 Energy Generation and Storage Segment Energy Generation and Storage Sales We record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are collected from customers related to fees charged for prepayments, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to $ 1.05 billion and $ 863 million, respectively, mainly due to billings for milestone payments. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 511 million and $ 132 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, total transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than one year was $ 1.91 billion. Of this amount, we expect to recognize $ 709 million in the next 12 months and the rest over the remaining performance obligation period. We have been providing loans for financing our energy generation products in volume since fiscal year 2022. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we have recorded net financing receivables on the consolidated balance sheets, of which $ 29 million and $ 24 million, respectively, is recorded within Accounts receivable, net, for the current portion and $ 541 million and $ 387 million, respectively, is recorded within Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. 11 Table of Contents Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized. The determination of the realizability of deferred tax assets requires significant judgment in assessing the likelihood of future tax consequences. In completing our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider our history of losses measured at pre-tax income (loss) adjusted for permanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional basis, volatility in actual earnings, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in recent prior years, and impacts of the timing of reversal of existing temporary differences. We also rely on our assessment of the Company’s projected future results of business operations, including uncertainty in future operating results relative to historical results, volatility in the market price of our common stock and its performance over time, variable macroeconomic conditions impacting our ability to forecast future taxable income, and changes in business that may affect the existence and magnitude of future taxable income. Our valuation allowance assessment is based on our best estimate of future results considering all available information. We monitor the realizability of the U.S. deferred tax assets taking into account all relevant factors. As of September 30, 2023, we continued to maintain a full valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets. We will release the valuation allowance when there is sufficient positive evidence to support a conclusion that it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Depending on our operating results and the amount of stock-based compensation tax deductions available in the future, we may release the valuation allowance associated with the U.S. deferred tax assets within the next year. The timing and amount of the valuation allowance release could vary based on our assessment of all available evidence. Release of all, or a portion, of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and may result in a material decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. There are transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the aggregate balances of our gross unrecognized tax benefits were $ 1.04 billion and $ 870 million, respectively, of which $ 616 million and $ 572 million, respectively, would not give rise to changes in our effective tax rate since these tax benefits would increase a deferred tax asset that is currently fully offset by a valuation allowance. We file income tax returns in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for the years 2015 to 2018. Additional tax years within the periods 2004 to 2014 and 2019 to 2022 remain subject to examination for federal income tax purposes. All net operating losses and tax credits generated to date are subject to adjustment for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. Our returns for 2004 and subsequent tax years remain subject to examination in U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions. Given the uncertainty in timing and outcome of our tax examinations, an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible change in gross unrecognized tax benefits within twelve months cannot be made at this time. Net Income per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders The following table presents the reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders to net income used in computing basic and diluted net income per share of common stock (in millions): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 1,853 $ 3,292 $ 7,069 $ 8,869 Less: Buy-out of noncontrolling interest 2 — ( 3 ) 8 Net income used in computing basic net income per share of common stock 1,851 3,292 7,072 8,861 Less: Dilutive convertible debt ( 0 ) ( 0 ) ( 0 ) ( 1 ) Net income used in computing diluted net income per share of common stock $ 1,851 $ 3,292 $ 7,072 $ 8,862 12 Table of Contents The following table presents the reconciliation of basic to diluted weighted average shares used in computing net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders (in millions): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Weighted average shares used in computing net income per share of common stock, basic 3,176 3,146 3,171 3,120 Add: Stock-based awards 304 301 297 311 Convertible senior notes 2 2 2 4 Warrants 11 19 11 39 Weighted average shares used in computing net income per share of common stock, diluted 3,493 3,468 3,481 3,474 The following table presents the potentially dilutive shares that were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders, because their effect was anti-dilutive (in millions): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Stock-based awards 13 3 12 3 Restricted Cash Our total cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows, was as follows (in millions): September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Cash and cash equivalents $ 15,932 $ 16,253 $ 19,532 $ 17,576 Restricted cash included in prepaid expenses and other current assets 453 294 382 345 Restricted cash included in other non-current assets 205 377 235 223 Total as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows $ 16,590 $ 16,924 $ 20,149 $ 18,144 Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Depending on the day of the week on which the end of a fiscal quarter falls, our accounts receivable balance may fluctuate as we are waiting for certain customer payments to clear through our banking institutions and receipts of payments from our financing partners, which can take up to approximately two weeks based on the contractual payment terms with such partners. Our accounts receivable balances associated with our sales of regulatory credits, which are typically transferred to other manufacturers during the last few days of the quarter, is dependent on contractual payment terms. Additionally, government rebates can take up to a year or more to be collected depending on the customary processing timelines of the specific jurisdictions issuing them. These various factors may have a significant impact on our accounts receivable balance from period to period. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had $ 328 million and $ 753 million, respectively, of long-term government rebates receivable in Other non-current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Financing Receivables As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the majority of our financing receivables were at current status with only immaterial balances being past due. As of September 30, 2023, the majority of our financing receivables, excluding MyPower notes receivable, were originated in 2023 and 2022, and as of December 31, 2022, the majority of our financing receivables, excluding MyPower notes receivable, were originated in 2022. 13 Table of Contents As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the total outstanding balance of MyPower customer notes receivable, net of allowance for expected credit losses, was $ 268 million and $ 280 million, respectively, of which $ 6 million and $ 7 million were due in the next 12 months as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the allowance for expected credit losses was $ 37 million. Concentration of Risk Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, investments, restricted cash, accounts receivable and financing receivables. Our cash and investments balances are primarily comprised of deposits which are diversified among high credit quality financial institutions or invested in U.S. government securities. These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, no entity represented 10% or more of our total receivables balance. Supply Risk We are dependent on our suppliers, including single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our products in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these components from these suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Operating Lease Vehicles The gross cost of operating lease vehicles as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $ 7.40 billion and $ 6.08 billion, respectively. Operating lease vehicles on the consolidated balance sheets are presented net of accumulated depreciation of $ 1.28 billion and $ 1.04 billion as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Goodwill Goodwill increased $ 56 million within the automotive segment from $ 194 million as of December 31, 2022 to $ 250 million as of September 30, 2023 primarily from a business combination and divestiture.

This ASU requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities (deferred revenue) from acquired contracts using the revenue recognition guidance in Topic 606. At the acquisition date, the acquirer applies the revenue model as if it had originated the acquired contracts. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted this ASU prospectively on January 1, 2023. This ASU has not and is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 14 Table of Contents In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. This ASU eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditors that have adopted ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which we adopted on January 1, 2020. This ASU also enhances the disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancing and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. In addition, the ASU amends the guidance on vintage disclosures to require entities to disclose current period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases within the scope of ASC 326-20. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted the ASU prospectively on January 1, 2023. This ASU has not and is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) was enacted into law and is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022. The IRA includes multiple incentives to promote clean energy, electric vehicles, battery and energy storage manufacture or purchase, in addition to a new corporate alternative minimum tax of 15% on adjusted financial statement income of corporations with profits greater than $1 billion. Some of these measures are expected to materially affect our consolidated financial statements. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the impact was primarily a reduction of our material costs. We will continue to evaluate the effects of the IRA as more guidance is issued and the relevant implications to our consolidated financial statements. Note 2 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements (“ASC 820”) states that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The three-tiered fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes which inputs should be used in measuring fair value, is comprised of: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level II) inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and (Level III) unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data. The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available in determining fair value. Our assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows (in millions): September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Fair Value Level I Level II Level III Fair Value Level I Level II Level III Money market funds $ 1,153 $ 1,153 $ — $ — $ 2,188 $ 2,188 $ — $ — U.S. government securities 4,798 — 4,798 — 894 — 894 — Corporate debt securities 559 — 559 — 885 — 885 — Certificates of deposit and time deposits 4,788 — 4,788 — 4,253 — 4,253 — Total $ 11,298 $ 1,153 $ 10,145 $ — $ 8,220 $ 2,188 $ 6,032 $ — All of our money market funds were classified within Level I of the fair value hierarchy because they were valued using quoted prices in active markets. Our U.S. government securities, certificates of deposit, time deposits and corporate debt securities are classified within Level II of the fair value hierarchy and the market approach was used to determine fair value of these investments. 15 Table of Contents Our cash, cash equivalents and investments classified by security type as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 consisted of the following (in millions): September 30, 2023 Adjusted Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Cash and Cash Equivalents Short-Term Investments Cash $ 14,779 $ — $ — $ 14,779 $ 14,779 $ — Money market funds 1,153 — — 1,153 1,153 — U.S. government securities 4,800 — ( 2 ) 4,798 — 4,798 Corporate debt securities 569 1 ( 11 ) 559 — 559 Certificates of deposit and time deposits 4,788 — — 4,788 — 4,788 Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments $ 26,089 $ 1 $ ( 13 ) $ 26,077 $ 15,932 $ 10,145 December 31, 2022 Adjusted Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Cash and Cash Equivalents Short-Term Investments Cash $ 13,965 $ — $ — $ 13,965 $ 13,965 $ — Money market funds 2,188 — — 2,188 2,188 — U.S. government securities 897 — ( 3 ) 894 — 894 Corporate debt securities 907 — ( 22 ) 885 — 885 Certificates of deposit and time deposits 4,252 1 — 4,253 100 4,153 Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments $ 22,209 $ 1 $ ( 25 ) $ 22,185 $ 16,253 $ 5,932 We record gross realized gains, losses and credit losses as a component of Other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, we did not recognize any material gross realized gains, losses or credit losses. The ending allowance balances for credit losses were immaterial as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. We have determined that the gross unrealized losses on our investments as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were temporary in nature. The following table summarizes the fair value of our investments by stated contractual maturities as of September 30, 2023 (in millions): Due in 1 year or less $ 9,734 Due in 1 year through 5 years 383 Due in 5 years through 10 years 28 Total $ 10,145 Disclosure of Fair Values Our financial instruments that are not re-measured at fair value include accounts receivable, financing receivables, other receivables, digital assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, customer deposits and debt. The carrying values of these financial instruments materially approximate their fair values, other than our 2.00 % Convertible Senior Notes due in 2024 (“2024 Notes”) and digital assets. 16 Table of Contents We estimate the fair value of the 2024 Notes using commonly accepted valuation methodologies and market-based risk measurements that are indirectly observable, such as credit risk (Level II). In addition, we estimate the fair values of our digital assets based on quoted prices in active markets (Level I). The following table presents the estimated fair values and the carrying values (in millions): September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value 2024 Notes $ 37 $ 452 $ 37 $ 223 Digital assets, net $ 184 $ 311 $ 184 $ 191 Note 3 – Inventory Our inventory consisted of the following (in millions): September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Raw materials $ 5,817 $ 6,137 Work in process 2,246 2,385 Finished goods (1) 4,550 3,475 Service parts 1,108 842 Total $ 13,721 $ 12,839 (1) Finished goods inventory includes vehicles in transit to fulfill customer orders, new vehicles available for sale, used vehicles and energy products available for sale.

Refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in our reporting on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 for the terms of the facility. (2) There were no restrictions on draw-down or use for general corporate purposes with respect to any available committed funds under our credit facilities, except certain specified conditions prior to draw-down, including pledging to our lenders sufficient amounts of qualified receivables, inventories, leased vehicles and our interests in those leases or various other assets as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in our report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to our general assets of the respective guarantors. Non-recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to only assets of our subsidiaries. The differences between the unpaid principal balances and the net carrying values are due to debt discounts or deferred issuance costs. As of September 30, 2023, we were in material compliance with all financial debt covenants. 2024 Notes During the first three quarters of 2023, the closing price of our common stock continued to exceed 130 % of the applicable conversion price of our 2024 Notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter, causing the 2024 Notes to be convertible by their holders during the second, third and fourth quarters of 2023. Should the closing price conditions continue to be met in a future quarter for the 2024 Notes, the 2024 Notes will be convertible at their holders’ option during the immediately following quarter. Automotive Asset-backed Notes In the third quarter of 2023, we transferred beneficial interests related to certain leased vehicles into special purpose entities and issued $ 2.53 billion in aggregate principal amount of Automotive Asset-backed Notes, with terms similar to our other previously issued Automotive Asset-backed Notes. The proceeds from the issuance, net of debt issuance costs, were $ 2.52 billion. Automotive Lease-backed Credit Facilities In the third quarter of 2023, we terminated our Automotive Lease-backed Credit Facilities and the previously committed funds are no longer available for future borrowings. 19 Table of Contents Note 8 – Equity Incentive Plans Other Performance-Based Grants From time to time, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors grants certain employees performance-based restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and stock options. As of September 30, 2023, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $ 525 million under these grants to purchase or receive an aggregate 4.7 million shares of our common stock. For awards probable of achievement, we estimate the unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $ 131 million will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3 years. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded $ 10 million and $ 56 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense related to these grants, net of forfeitures. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, we recorded $ 31 million and $ 134 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense related to these grants, net of forfeitures. Summary Stock-Based Compensation Information The following table summarizes our stock-based compensation expense by line item in the consolidated statements of operations (in millions): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Cost of revenues $ 181 $ 150 $ 554 $ 424 Research and development 189 124 491 389 Selling, general and administrative 95 88 283 328 Total $ 465 $ 362 $ 1,328 $ 1,141 Our income tax benefits recognized from stock-based compensation arrangements in each of the periods presented were immaterial due to cumulative losses and valuation allowances. Note 9 – Commitments and Contingencies Operating Lease Arrangements in Buffalo, New York and Shanghai, China For a description of our operating lease arrangements in Buffalo, New York, and Shanghai, China, refer to Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies , in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. As of September 30, 2023, we expect to meet the requirements under these arrangements based on our current and anticipated level of operations. Legal Proceedings Litigation Relating to the SolarCity Acquisition Between September 1, 2016 and October 5, 2016, seven lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery by purported stockholders of Tesla challenging our acquisition of SolarCity Corporation (“SolarCity”). Following consolidation, the lawsuit names as defendants the members of Tesla’s board of directors as then constituted and alleges, among other things, that board members breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the acquisition. The complaint asserts both derivative claims and direct claims on behalf of a purported class and seeks, among other relief, unspecified monetary damages, attorneys’ fees and costs. On January 22, 2020, all of the director defendants except Elon Musk reached a settlement to resolve the lawsuit against them for an amount to be paid entirely under the applicable insurance policy. The settlement, which does not involve an admission of any wrongdoing by any party, was approved by the Court on August 17, 2020. Tesla received payment of approximately $ 43 million on September 16, 2020, which has been recognized in our consolidated statements of operations as a reduction to Selling, general and administrative operating expenses for costs previously incurred related to the acquisition of SolarCity. The trial was held from July 12 to July 23, 2021 and on August 16, 2021. On October 22, 2021, the Court approved the parties’ joint stipulation that (a) the class is decertified and the action shall continue exclusively as a derivative action under Court of Chancery Rule 23.1 and (b) the direct claims against Elon Musk are dismissed with prejudice. Following post-trial briefing, post-trial argument was held on January 18, 2022. 20 Table of Contents On April 27, 2022, the Court entered judgment in favor of Mr. Musk on all counts. On May 26, 2022, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal. Oral argument was held before the Supreme Court of Delaware on March 29, 2023, and on June 6, 2023, the Supreme Court of Delaware affirmed the Court of Chancery’s decision. These plaintiffs and others filed parallel actions in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on or about April 21, 2017. They include claims for violations of the federal securities laws and breach of fiduciary duties by Tesla’s board of directors. Those actions were consolidated and stayed pending the above-referenced Chancery Court litigation. On October 16, 2023, these plaintiffs filed a voluntary dismissal of the action. Litigation Relating to 2018 CEO Performance Award On June 4, 2018, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a putative class and derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Elon Musk and the members of Tesla’s board of directors as then constituted, alleging corporate waste, unjust enrichment and that such board members breached their fiduciary duties by approving the stock-based compensation plan awarded to Elon Musk in 2018. The complaint seeks, among other things, monetary damages and rescission or reformation of the stock-based compensation plan. On August 31, 2018, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint; plaintiff filed its opposition brief on November 1, 2018; and defendants filed a reply brief on December 13, 2018. The hearing on the motion to dismiss was held on May 9, 2019. On September 20, 2019, the Court granted the motion to dismiss as to the corporate waste claim but denied the motion as to the breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims. Defendants’ answer was filed on December 3, 2019. On January 25, 2021, the Court conditionally certified certain claims and a class of Tesla stockholders as a class action. On September 30, 2021, plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file a verified amended derivative complaint. On October 1, 2021, defendants Kimbal Musk and Steve Jurvetson moved for summary judgment as to the claims against them. Following the motion, plaintiff agreed to voluntarily dismiss the claims against Kimbal Musk and Steve Jurvetson. Plaintiff also moved for summary judgment on October 1, 2021. On October 27, 2021, the Court approved the parties’ joint stipulation that, among other things, (a) all claims against Kimbal Musk and Steve Jurvetson in the Complaint are dismissed with prejudice; (b) the class is decertified and the action shall continue exclusively as a derivative action under Court of Chancery Rule 23.1; and (c) the direct claims against the remaining defendants are dismissed with prejudice. On November 18, 2021, the remaining defendants (a) moved for partial summary judgment, (b) opposed plaintiff’s summary judgment motion and (c) opposed the plaintiff’s motion to amend his complaint. In January 2022, the case was assigned to a different judge. On February 24, 2022, the court (i) granted plaintiff’s motion to amend his complaint, and (ii) canceled oral argument on the summary judgment motions, stating that the court is “skeptical that this litigation can be resolved based on the undisputed facts” and the “case is going to trial,” but that the “parties may reassert their arguments made in support of summary judgment in their pre-trial and post-trial briefs.” Trial was held November 14-18, 2022. Post-trial briefing and argument are now complete. Litigation Related to Directors’ Compensation On June 17, 2020, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla’s current and former directors regarding compensation awards granted to Tesla’s directors, other than Elon Musk, between 2017 and 2020. The suit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages and other relief. Defendants filed their answer on September 17, 2020. Trial is currently set for November 27, 2023, to December 1, 2023. On July 14, 2023, the parties filed a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise and Settlement, which does not involve an admission of any wrongdoing by any party. If the settlement is approved by the Court, this action will be fully settled and dismissed with prejudice. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Tesla provided notice of the proposed settlement to stockholders of record as of July 14, 2023. The general terms, conditions and timing of this proposed settlement are further set forth in the Form 8-K filed on July 20, 2023, which includes, among other things, the court-approved notice of the proposed settlement. The Court held a hearing regarding the settlement on October 13, 2023, after which it took the settlement and plaintiff counsels’ fee request under advisement. The settlement is not expected to have an adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. 21 Table of Contents Litigation Relating to Potential Going Private Transaction Between August 10, 2018 and September 6, 2018, nine purported stockholder class actions were filed against Tesla and Elon Musk in connection with Mr. Musk’s August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. On January 16, 2019, Plaintiffs filed their consolidated complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and added as defendants the members of Tesla’s board of directors. The consolidated complaint asserts claims for violations of the federal securities laws and seeks unspecified damages and other relief. The parties stipulated to certification of a class of stockholders, which the court granted on November 25, 2020. Trial started on January 17, 2023, and on February 3, 2023, a jury rendered a verdict in favor of the defendants on all counts. After trial, plaintiffs filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law and a motion for new trial, which the Court denied and judgement was entered in favor of defendants on July 11, 2023. On July 14, 2023, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal. Between October 17, 2018 and March 8, 2021, seven derivative lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of Tesla’s board of directors, as constituted at relevant times, in relation to statements made and actions connected to a potential going private transaction, with certain of the lawsuits challenging additional Twitter posts by Mr. Musk, among other things. Five of those actions were consolidated, and all seven actions have been stayed pending resolution of the above-referenced consolidated purported stockholder class action. In addition to these cases, two derivative lawsuits were filed on October 25, 2018 and February 11, 2019 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of the Tesla board of directors as then constituted. Those cases have also been consolidated and stayed pending resolution of the appeal in the above-referenced consolidated purported stockholder class action. On October 21, 2022, a lawsuit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery by a purported shareholder of Tesla alleging, among other things, that board members breached their fiduciary duties in connection with their oversight of the Company’s 2018 settlement with the SEC, as amended. Among other things, the plaintiff seeks reforms to the Company’s corporate governance and internal procedures, unspecified damages, and attorneys’ fees. The parties reached an agreement to stay the case until December 5, 2023. On November 15, 2021, JPMorgan Chase Bank (“JP Morgan”) filed a lawsuit against Tesla in the Southern District of New York alleging breach of a stock warrant agreement that was entered into as part of a convertible notes offering in 2014. In 2018, JP Morgan informed Tesla that it had adjusted the strike price based upon Mr. Musk’s August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. Tesla disputed JP Morgan’s adjustment as a violation of the parties’ agreement. In 2021, Tesla delivered shares to JP Morgan per the agreement, which they duly accepted. JP Morgan now alleges that it is owed approximately $ 162 million as the value of additional shares that it claims should have been delivered as a result of the adjustment to the strike price in 2018. On January 24, 2022, Tesla filed multiple counterclaims as part of its answer to the underlying lawsuit, asserting among other points that JP Morgan should have terminated the stock warrant agreement in 2018 rather than make an adjustment to the strike price that it should have known would lead to a commercially unreasonable result. Tesla believes that the adjustments made by JP Morgan were neither proper nor commercially reasonable, as required under the stock warrant agreements. JP Morgan filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, which Tesla opposed, and that motion is currently pending before the Court. Litigation and Investigations Relating to Alleged Discrimination and Harassment On October 4, 2021, in a case captioned Diaz v. Tesla , a jury in the Northern District of California returned a verdict against Tesla on claims by a former contingent worker that he was subjected to race discrimination while assigned to work at Tesla’s Fremont Factory from 2015-2016. On November 16, 2021, Tesla filed a post-trial motion for relief that included a request for a new trial or reduction of the jury’s damages. On April 13, 2022, the Court granted Tesla’s motion in part, reducing the total damages and conditionally denied the motion for a new trial subject to the plaintiff’s acceptance of the reduced award. On June 21, 2022, the plaintiff rejected the reduced award and, as a result, on June 27, 2022, the Court ordered a new trial on damages only, which commenced on March 27, 2023, after which a jury returned a verdict of $ 3,175,000 . As a result, the damages awarded against Tesla were reduced from an initial $ 136.9 million (October 4, 2021) down to $ 15 million (April 13, 2022), and then further down to $ 3.175 million (April 3, 2023). On February 9, 2022, shortly after the first Diaz jury verdict, the California Civil Rights Department (”CRD,” formerly “DFEH”) filed a civil complaint against Tesla in Alameda County, California Superior Court, alleging systemic race discrimination, hostile work environment and pay equity claims, among others. CRD’s amended complaint seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief. On September 22, 2022, Tesla filed a cross complaint against CRD, alleging that it violated the Administrative Procedures Act by failing to follow statutory pre-requisites prior to filing suit and that cross complaint was subject to a sustained demurrer, which Tesla later amended and refiled. The case is now in discovery. 22 Table of Contents Additionally, on June 1, 2022 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) issued a cause finding against Tesla that closely parallels the CRD’s allegations. Tesla engaged in a mandatory mediation with the EEOC in June 2023, which did not result in a resolution. On September 28, 2023, the EEOC filed a civil complaint against Tesla in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California asserting claims for race harassment and retaliation and seeking, among other things, monetary and injunctive relief. On June 16, 2022, two Tesla stockholders filed separate derivative actions in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla’s current and former directors. Both suits assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and violation of the federal securities laws in connection with alleged race and gender discrimination and sexual harassment. Among other things, plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages payable to Tesla, and attorneys’ fees. On July 22, 2022, the Court consolidated the two cases and on September 6, 2022, plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. On November 7, 2022, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the case. Plaintiffs filed a response of January 13, 2023, and the defendants replied on February 17, 2023. On September 15, 2023, the Court dismissed the action but granted plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint. Other Litigation Related to Our Products and Services We are also subject to various lawsuits that seek monetary and other injunctive relief. These lawsuits include proposed class actions and other consumer claims that allege, among other things, defects and misrepresentations related to our products and services. For example, on September 14, 2022, a proposed class action was filed against Tesla, Inc. and related entities in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging various claims about the Company’s driver assistance technology systems under state and federal law. This case was later consolidated with several other proposed class actions, and a Consolidated Amended Complaint was filed on October 28, 2022, which seeks damages and other relief on behalf of all persons who purchased or leased from Tesla between January 1, 2016 to the present. On October 5, 2022 a proposed class action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York asserting similar state and federal law claims against the same defendants. On September 30, 2023, the Court dismissed this action with leave to amend the complaint. On March 22, 2023, the plaintiffs in the California consolidated action filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to order Tesla to (1) cease using the term “Full Self-Driving Capability” (FSDC), (2) cease the sale and activation of FSDC and deactivate FSDC on Tesla vehicles, and (3) provide certain notices to consumers about proposed court-findings about the accuracy of the use of the terms Autopilot and FSDC. Tesla opposed the motion. On September 30, 2023, the Court denied the request for a preliminary injunction, compelled four of five plaintiffs to arbitration, and dismissed the claims of the fifth plaintiff with leave to amend the complaint. Subsequently, on October 2, 2023, a similar proposed class action was filed in San Diego County Superior Court in California. On February 27, 2023, a proposed class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against Tesla, Inc., Elon Musk and certain current and former Company executives. The complaint alleges that the defendants made material misrepresentations and omissions about the Company’s Autopilot and FSDC technologies and seeks money damages and other relief on behalf of persons who purchased Tesla stock between February 19, 2019 and February 17, 2023. An amended complaint was filed on September 5, 2023, naming only Tesla, Inc. and Elon Musk as defendants. On April 13, 2023, a putative Tesla shareholder filed a related shareholder derivative complaint against the members of Tesla’s board of directors and certain current and former executives, alleging contribution for violations of the federal securities law, breach of fiduciary duties, waste, and unjust enrichment. The complaint asserted derivative claims and seeks, among other relief, unspecified monetary damages, attorneys’ fees and costs. On July 19, 2023, the plaintiff in the shareholder derivative action voluntarily dismissed the complaint without prejudice. On March 14, 2023, a proposed class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Several similar complaints have also been filed in the same court and these cases have now all been consolidated. These complaints allege that Tesla violates federal antitrust and warranty laws through its repair, service, and maintenance practices and seeks, among other relief, damages for persons who paid Tesla for repairs services or Tesla compatible replacement parts from March 2019 to March 2023. On July 17, 2023, these plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself in these matters; however, we cannot predict the outcome or impact. We are unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these claims, unless noted. 23 Table of Contents Certain Investigations and Other Matters We receive requests for information from regulators and governmental authorities, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board, the SEC, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and various local, state, federal and international agencies. We routinely cooperate with such regulatory and governmental requests, including subpoenas, formal and informal requests and other investigations and inquiries. For example, the SEC had issued subpoenas to Tesla in connection with Elon Musk’s prior statement that he was considering taking Tesla private. The take-private investigation was resolved and closed with a settlement entered into with the SEC in September 2018 and as further clarified in April 2019 in an amendment. The SEC also has periodically issued subpoenas to us seeking information on our governance processes around compliance with the SEC settlement, as amended. Separately, the Company has received requests for information, including subpoenas, from the DOJ. These have included requests for documents related to Tesla’s Autopilot and FSD features. Additionally, the Company has received requests for information, including subpoenas from the DOJ, regarding certain matters associated with personal benefits, related parties, vehicle range and personnel decisions. To our knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. We cannot predict the outcome or impact of any ongoing matters. Should the government decide to pursue an enforcement action, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation, prospects, cash flows, financial position or brand. We are also subject to various other legal proceedings, risks and claims that arise from the normal course of business activities. For example, during the second quarter of 2023, a foreign news outlet reported that it obtained certain misappropriated data including, purportedly, among other things, non-public Tesla business and personal information. Tesla has made notifications to potentially affected individuals (current and former employees) and regulatory authorities and we are working with certain law enforcement and other authorities. On August 5, 2023, a putative class action was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, purportedly on behalf of all U.S. individuals impacted by the data incident, followed by several additional lawsuits, that each assert claims under various state laws and seeks monetary damages and other relief. If an unfavorable ruling or development were to occur in these or other possible legal proceedings, risks and claims, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position or brand. 24 Table of Contents Note 10 – Variable Interest Entity Arrangements The aggregate carrying values of the variable interest entities’ assets and liabilities, after elimination of any intercompany transactions and balances, in the consolidated balance sheets were as follows (in millions): September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Assets Current assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 78 $ 68 Accounts receivable, net 30 22 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 341 274 Total current assets 449 364 Solar energy systems, net 3,921 4,060 Other non-current assets 390 404 Total assets $ 4,760 $ 4,828 Liabilities Current liabilities Accrued liabilities and other $ 73 $ 69 Deferred revenue 10 10 Current portion of debt and finance leases 1,512 1,013 Total current liabilities 1,595 1,092 Deferred revenue, net of current portion 145 149 Debt and finance leases, net of current portion 2,134 971 Other long-term liabilities — 3 Total liabilities $ 3,874 $ 2,215 Note 11 – Segment Reporting and Information about Geographic Areas We have two operating and reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Overview Our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. We design, develop, manufacture, lease and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles, solar energy generation systems and energy storage products. We also offer maintenance, installation, operation, financial and other services related to our products. Additionally, we are increasingly focused on products and services based on artificial intelligence, robotics and automation. In 2023, we produced 1,350,996 consumer vehicles and delivered 1,324,074 consumer vehicles through the third quarter. We are currently focused on increasing vehicle production, capacity and delivery capabilities, reducing costs, improving and developing our vehicles and battery technologies, vertically integrating and localizing our supply chain, improving and further deploying our FSD capabilities, increasing the affordability and efficiency of our vehicles, bringing new products to market and expanding our global infrastructure. In 2023, we deployed 11.52 GWh of energy storage products and 182 megawatts of solar energy systems through the third quarter. We are currently focused on ramping production of energy storage products, improving our Solar Roof installation capability and efficiency, and increasing market share of retrofit solar energy systems. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized total revenues of $23.35 billion and $71.61 billion, respectively, representing increases of $1.90 billion and $14.46 billion, respectively, over the same periods ended September 30, 2022. We continue to ramp production, build new manufacturing capacity, invest in research and development and expand our operations to enable increased deliveries and deployments of our products and further revenue growth. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, our net income attributable to common stockholders was $1.85 billion and $7.07 billion, respectively, representing unfavorable changes of $1.44 billion and $1.80 billion, respectively, over the same periods ended September 30, 2022. We continue to focus on further cost reductions and operational efficiencies while maximizing delivery volumes. We ended the third quarter of 2023 with $26.08 billion in cash and cash equivalents and investments, representing an increase of $3.89 billion from the end of 2022. Our cash flows provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 were $8.89 billion and $11.45 billion, respectively, representing a decrease of $2.56 billion. Capital expenditures amounted to $6.59 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $5.30 billion during the same period ended September 30, 2022, representing an increase of $1.29 billion. Sustained growth has allowed our business to generally fund itself, and we will continue investing in a number of capital-intensive projects and research and development in upcoming periods. Management Opportunities, Challenges and Uncertainties and 2023 Outlook Automotive—Production The following is a summary of the status of production of each of our announced vehicle models in production and under development, as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q: Production Location Vehicle Model(s) Production Status Fremont Factory Model S / Model X Active Model 3 / Model Y Active Gigafactory Shanghai Model 3 / Model Y Active Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg Model Y Active Gigafactory Texas Model Y Active Cybertruck Pilot production Gigafactory Nevada Tesla Semi Pilot production Various Next Generation Platform In development TBD Tesla Roadster In development 27 Table of Contents We are focused on growing our manufacturing capacity, which includes capacity for manufacturing new vehicle models such as our Cybertruck and next generation platform, and ramping all of our production vehicles to their installed production capacities as well as increasing production rate and efficiency at our current factories. The next phase of production growth will depend on the ramp at Gigafactory Texas and Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg, as well as our ability to add to our available sources of battery cell supply by manufacturing our own cells that we are developing to have high-volume output, lower capital and production costs and longer range. Our goals are to improve vehicle performance, decrease production costs and increase affordability and customer awareness. These plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations, which may be exacerbated by new product and manufacturing technologies we introduce, the number of concurrent international projects, any industry-wide component constraints, labor shortages and any future impact from events outside of our control. For example, during the third quarter of 2023, we experienced a sequential decline in production volumes due to pre-planned shutdowns for upgrades at various factories. Moreover, we have set ambitious technological targets with our plans for battery cells as well as for iterative manufacturing and design improvements for our vehicles with each new factory. Automotive—Demand, Sales, Deliveries and Infrastructure Our cost reduction efforts, cost innovation strategies, and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our vehicles’ affordability and have allowed us to competitively price our vehicles. We will also continue to generate demand and brand awareness by improving our vehicles’ performance and functionality, including through products based on artificial intelligence such as Autopilot and FSD, and other software features and delivering new vehicles, such as our upcoming Cybertruck. Moreover, we expect to continue to benefit from ongoing electrification of the automotive sector and increasing environmental regulations and initiatives. However, we operate in a cyclical industry that is sensitive to political and regulatory uncertainty, including with respect to trade and the environment, all of which can be compounded by inflationary pressures, rising energy prices, increases in interest rates and the liquidity of enterprise customers. For example, inflationary pressures have increased across the markets in which we operate. In an effort to curb this trend, central banks in developed countries raised interest rates rapidly and substantially, impacting the affordability of vehicle lease and finance arrangements. Further, sales of vehicles in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to increased volatility as we expand and adjust our operations. Moreover, as additional competitors enter the marketplace and help bring the world closer to sustainable transportation, we will have to adjust and continue to execute well to maintain our momentum. Additionally, our suppliers’ liquidity and allocation plans may be affected by current challenges in the North American automotive industry, which could reduce our access to components or result in unfavorable changes to cost. These macroeconomic and industry trends have had, and will likely continue to have, an impact on the pricing of, and order rate for our vehicles, and in turn our operating margin. We will continue to adjust accordingly to such developments, and we believe our ongoing cost reduction, including improved production innovation and efficiency at our newest factories and lower logistics costs, and focus on operating leverage will continue to benefit us in relation to our competitors, while our new products will help enable future growth. As our production increases, we must work constantly to similarly increase vehicle delivery capability so that it does not become a bottleneck on our total deliveries. We are also committed to reducing the percentage of vehicles delivered in the third month of each quarter, which will help to reduce the cost per vehicle. As we expand our manufacturing operations globally, we will also have to continue to increase and staff our delivery, servicing and charging infrastructure accordingly, maintain our vehicle reliability and optimize our Supercharger locations to ensure cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction. In particular, as other automotive manufacturers have announced their adoption of the North American Charging Standard (“NACS”) and agreements with us to utilize our Superchargers, we must correspondingly expand our network in order to ensure adequate availability to meet customer demands. We also remain focused on continued enhancements of the capability and efficiency of our servicing operations. 28 Table of Contents Energy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment The long-term success of this business is dependent upon increasing margins through greater volumes. We continue to increase the production of our energy storage products to meet high levels of demand, including the announcement of a new Megafactory in Shanghai and the ongoing ramp at our Megafactory in Lathrop, California. For Megapack, energy storage deployments can vary meaningfully quarter to quarter depending on the timing of specific project milestones. We remain committed to growing our retrofit solar energy business by offering a low-cost and simplified online ordering experience. In addition, we continue to seek to improve our installation capabilities and price efficiencies for Solar Roof. As these product lines grow, we will have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage products and ensure the availability of qualified personnel, particularly skilled electricians, to support the ramp of Solar Roof. Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends Our capital expenditures are typically difficult to project beyond the short-term given the number and breadth of our core projects at any given time, and may further be impacted by uncertainties in future global market conditions. We are simultaneously ramping new products, building or ramping manufacturing facilities on three continents, piloting the development and manufacture of new battery cell technologies, expanding our Supercharger network and investing in autonomy and other artificial intelligence enabled training and products, and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending on overall priority among projects, the pace at which we meet milestones, production adjustments to and among our various products, increased capital efficiencies and the addition of new projects. Owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced projects under development, all other continuing infrastructure growth and varying levels of inflation, we currently expect our capital expenditures to exceed $9.00 billion in 2023 and be between $7.00 to $9.00 billion in each of the following two fiscal years. Our business has been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend, and with better working capital management resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding, our sales growth is also generally facilitating positive cash generation. We have and will continue to utilize such cash flows, among other things, to do more vertical integration, expand our product roadmap and provide financing options to our customers. At the same time, we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods depending on the specific pace of our capital-intensive projects and other potential variables such as rising material prices and increases in supply chain and labor expenses resulting from changes in global trade conditions and labor availability. Overall, we expect our ability to be self-funding to continue as long as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales.

Additionally, there was a lower average selling price on our vehicles driven by overall price reductions year over year, sales mix, and a negative impact from the United States dollar strengthening against other foreign currencies in the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the prior period. Automotive sales revenue increased $10.91 billion, or 23%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to an increase of 394,409 combined Model 3 and Model Y cash deliveries from production ramping of Model Y globally. The increase was partially offset by lower average selling price on our vehicles for the same factors mentioned above. Automotive regulatory credits revenue increased $268 million, or 94%, in the three months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022. Automotive regulatory credits revenue increased $48 million, or 4%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022. In the first quarter of 2022, we recognized $288 million in revenue primarily due to changes in regulation which entitled us to additional consideration for credits sold previously. Automotive leasing revenue decreased $132 million, or 21%, in the three months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022. Automotive leasing revenue decreased $257 million, or 14%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The decreases were primarily due to a decrease in direct sales-type leasing revenue driven by lower deliveries year over year, partially offset by an increase from our growing direct operating lease portfolio. Services and other revenue increased $521 million, or 32%, in the three months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022. Services and other revenue increased $1.76 billion, or 40%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increases were primarily due to higher used vehicle revenue driven by increases in volume, non-warranty maintenance services revenue, body shop and part sales revenue, paid Supercharging revenue and insurance services revenue, all of which are primarily attributable to our growing fleet. Additionally, there was an increase in retail merchandise revenue, partially offset by decreases in the average selling price of used vehicles. Energy Generation and Storage Segment Energy generation and storage revenue increased $442 million, or 40%, in the three months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022. Energy generation and storage revenue increased $2.00 billion, or 77%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increases were primarily due to an increase in deployments of Megapack. 30 Table of Contents Cost of Revenues and Gross Margin Three Months Ended September 30, Change Nine Months Ended September 30, Change (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 $ % 2023 2022 $ % Cost of revenues Automotive sales $ 15,656 $ 13,099 $ 2,557 20 % $ 47,919 $ 34,166 $ 13,753 40 % Automotive leasing 301 381 (80) (21) % 972 1,157 (185) (16) % Total automotive cost of revenues 15,957 13,480 2,477 18 % 48,891 35,323 13,568 38 % Services and other 2,037 1,579 458 29 % 5,723 4,275 1,448 34 % Total automotive & services and other segment cost of revenues 17,994 15,059 2,935 19 % 54,614 39,598 15,016 38 % Energy generation and storage segment 1,178 1,013 165 16 % 3,770 2,470 1,300 53 % Total cost of revenues $ 19,172 $ 16,072 $ 3,100 19 % $ 58,384 $ 42,068 $ 16,316 39 % Gross profit total automotive $ 3,668 $ 5,212 $ 11,965 $ 14,832 Gross margin total automotive 18.7 % 27.9 % 19.7 % 29.6 % Gross profit total automotive & services and other segment $ 3,797 $ 5,278 $ 12,395 $ 14,947 Gross margin total automotive & services and other segment 17.4 % 26.0 % 18.5 % 27.4 % Gross profit energy generation and storage segment $ 381 $ 104 $ 827 $ 129 Gross margin energy generation and storage segment 24.4 % 9.3 % 18.0 % 5.0 % Total gross profit $ 4,178 $ 5,382 $ 13,222 $ 15,076 Total gross margin 17.9 % 25.1 % 18.5 % 26.4 % Automotive & Services and Other Segment Cost of automotive sales revenue increased $2.56 billion, or 20%, in the three months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022.

R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue increased from 3% to 5% in the three months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue stayed consistent at 4% in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. The growth of our R&D expenses have outpaced the growth of our revenue in pre-production periods and as we continue to invest more heavily in our product roadmap and technologies.

This was driven by a $309 million increase in employee and labor costs primarily from increased headcount, including professional services and a $273 million increase in facilities related expenses.

This increase was primarily due to higher interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the prior periods due to rising interest rates and our increasing portfolio balance.

Our effective tax rate remains at 8% in the three months ended September 30, 2023 and increased from 9% to 10% in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, primarily due to changes in mix of jurisdictional earnings. 33 Table of Contents See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details. Liquidity and Capital Resources We expect to continue to generate net positive operating cash flow as we have done in the last five fiscal years. The cash we generate from our core operations enables us to fund ongoing operations and production, our research and development projects for new products and technologies including our proprietary battery cells, additional manufacturing ramps at existing manufacturing facilities, the construction of future factories, and the continued expansion of our retail and service locations, body shops, Mobile Service fleet, Supercharger, including to support NACS, energy product installation capabilities and autonomy and other artificial intelligence enabled products. In addition, because a large portion of our future expenditures will be to fund our growth, we expect that if needed we will be able to adjust our capital and operating expenditures by operating segment. For example, if our near-term manufacturing operations decrease in scale or ramp more slowly than expected, including due to global economic or business conditions, we may choose to correspondingly slow the pace of our capital expenditures. Finally, we continually evaluate our cash needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital or seek alternative financing sources to fund the rapid growth of our business, including through drawdowns on existing or new debt facilities or financing funds. Conversely, we may also from time to time determine that it is in our best interests to voluntarily repay certain indebtedness early. Accordingly, we believe that our current sources of funds will provide us with adequate liquidity during the 12-month period following September 30, 2023, as well as in the long-term. See the sections below for more details regarding the material requirements for cash in our business and our sources of liquidity to meet such needs. Material Cash Requirements From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with vendors for the purchase of components and raw materials to be used in the manufacture of our products. However, due to contractual terms, variability in the precise growth curves of our development and production ramps, and opportunities to renegotiate pricing, we generally do not have binding and enforceable purchase orders under such contracts beyond the short-term, and the timing and magnitude of purchase orders beyond such period is difficult to accurately project. As discussed in and subject to the considerations referenced in Part I, Item 2, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Management Opportunities, Challenges and Uncertainties and 2023 Outlook—Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we currently expect our capital expenditures to support our projects globally to exceed $9.00 billion in 2023 and be between $7.00 to $9.00 billion in each of the following two fiscal years. We also have certain obligations in connection with our operations at Gigafactory New York and Gigafactory Shanghai, as outlined in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Material Cash Requirements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. As of September 30, 2023, we and our subsidiaries had outstanding $3.73 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness, of which $1.56 billion is scheduled to become due in the succeeding 12 months. For details regarding our indebtedness, refer to Note 7, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Sources and Conditions of Liquidity Our sources to fund our material cash requirements are predominantly from our deliveries and servicing of new and used vehicles, sales and installations of our energy storage products and solar energy systems, proceeds from debt facilities and proceeds from equity offerings, when applicable. As of September 30, 2023, we had $15.93 billion and $10.15 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, respectively. Balances held in foreign currencies had a U.S. dollar equivalent of $3.86 billion and consisted primarily of Chinese yuan, euros and Canadian dollar. We had $5.00 billion of unused committed amounts under our revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2023. For details regarding our indebtedness, refer to Note 7 , Debt , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 34 Table of Contents We continue adapting our strategy to meet our liquidity and risk objectives, such as investing in U.S. government and other investments, to do more vertical integration, expand our product roadmap and provide financing options to our customers. Summary of Cash Flows Nine Months Ended September 30, (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 8,886 $ 11,446 Net cash used in investing activities $ (10,780) $ (5,842) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 1,702 $ (3,032) Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $2.56 billion to $8.89 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 from $11.45 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. This decrease was primarily due to unfavorable changes in net operating assets and liabilities of $1.33 billion and the decrease in net income excluding non-cash expenses, gains and losses of $1.23 billion. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Cash flows from investing activities and their variability across each period related primarily to capital expenditures, which were $6.59 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and $5.30 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, mainly for global factory expansion and machinery and equipment as we expand our product roadmap. We also purchased $4.12 billion and $1.46 billion of investments, net of proceeds from maturities and sales, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively. Additionally, net cash inflows related to sales of digital assets were $936 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash from financing activities changed by $4.73 billion to $1.70 billion net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 from $3.03 billion net cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The change was primarily due to a $2.53 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt and a $2.11 billion decrease in repayments of debt. See Note 7, Debt , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details regarding our debt obligations. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Risk We transact business globally in multiple currencies and hence have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, costs of revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (primarily the Chinese yuan, euro, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar in relation to our current year operations). In general, we are a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar for our foreign subsidiaries. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars as we do not typically hedge foreign currency risk. We have also experienced, and will continue to experience, fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local currency (primarily consisting of our intercompany and cash and cash equivalents balances). We considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is reasonably possible that adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near-term. These changes were applied to our total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our local currencies at the balance sheet date to compute the impact these changes would have had on our net income before income taxes. These changes would have resulted in a gain or loss of $688 million at September 30, 2023 and $473 million at December 31, 2022, assuming no foreign currency hedging. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were designed at a reasonable assurance level and were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2023, which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS For a description of our material pending legal proceedings, please see Note 9, Commitments and Contingencies , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, each of the matters below is being disclosed pursuant to Item 103 of Regulation S-K because it relates to environmental regulations and aggregate civil penalties that we currently believe could potentially exceed $1 million. We believe that any proceeding that is material to our business or financial condition is likely to have potential penalties far in excess of such amount. District attorneys in certain California counties conducted an investigation into Tesla’s waste segregation practices pursuant to Cal. Health & Saf. Code § 25100 et seq. and Cal. Civil Code § 1798.80. Tesla has implemented various remedial measures, including conducting training and audits, and enhancements to its site waste management programs, and settlement discussions are ongoing. While the outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time, it is not currently expected to have a material adverse impact on our business. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, which could adversely affect our business, financial conditions and future results.

{"text": "Tesla 'Full Self-Driving' may be an important differentiator in China: Analyst Shares Tesla (TSLA) are moving lower on Tuesday morning as the company's sales in China fell 18% year-over-year for the month of April, according to the China Passenger Car Association. The company has already been hit with falling sales in China as competition increases, causing the automaker to lower prices on select models. Morningstar Equities Strategist Seth Goldstein joins The Morning Brief to give insight into Tesla's current operations and how the company can move forward. Goldstein discusses the nature of electric vehicle competition in China: \"So I think for Tesla within China, they're not in the affordable vehicle market.
