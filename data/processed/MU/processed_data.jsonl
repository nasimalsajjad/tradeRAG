Marketing and Customers We seek to build collaborative relationships with our customers to understand their unique opportunities and challenges. By engaging with our customers early in the product life-cycle to identify and design features and performance characteristics into our products, we are able to manufacture products that anticipate and address our customers’ changing needs. Collaborating with our customers on their design needs in changing end markets and meeting their timelines for qualifying new products allows us to differentiate our memory and storage solutions, which provides greater value to our customers. Our semiconductor memory and storage products are offered under our Micron and Crucial brand names and through private labels. We market our semiconductor memory and storage products primarily through our own direct sales force and maintain sales or representative offices to support our worldwide customer base. Our products are also offered through distributors, retailers, and independent sales representatives. Our distributors carry our products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products, including our competitors’ products. Our independent sales representatives obtain orders, subject to final acceptance by us, and we then make shipments against these orders directly to customers or through our distributors. We sell our Crucial-branded products through a web-based customer-direct sales channel as well as through channel and distribution partners. We maintain inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of products. 10 Table of Contents Due to volatile industry conditions, our customers are generally reluctant to enter into long-term, fixed-price purchase contracts. We typically enter into long-term agreements with our customers with acknowledgment that pricing, quantity, and other terms will be periodically negotiated to reflect market conditions and our customer’s demand for our products. In each of the last three years, approximately one-half of our total revenue was from our top ten customers. For other information regarding our concentrations and customers, see “Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Certain Concentrations.” Competitive Conditions We face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets from a number of companies, including Kioxia Holdings Corporation; Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.; SK hynix Inc.; and Western Digital Corporation. Our competitors may use aggressive pricing to obtain market share. Some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have a larger market share and greater resources to invest in technology, capitalize on growth opportunities, and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete. Consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage as our competitors may benefit from increased manufacturing scale and a stronger product portfolio. We operate in different jurisdictions than our competitors and may be impacted by unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. In addition, some governments may provide, or have provided and may continue to provide, significant assistance, financial or otherwise, to some of our competitors or to new entrants and may intervene in support of national industries and/or competitors. In particular, we face the threat of increasing competition as a result of significant investment in the semiconductor industry by the Chinese government and various state-owned or affiliated entities, in companies such as Yangtze Memory Technologies Co., Ltd. (“YMTC”) and ChangXin Memory Technologies, Inc. (“CXMT”). In addition, the May 2023 decision by China’s Cyberspace Administration (the “CAC”) that critical information infrastructure operators in China may not purchase Micron products had an adverse impact on our ability to compete effectively in China and elsewhere. We and our competitors generally seek to increase supply to address growing market demands, improve yields, and reduce die size, which could result in significant increases in worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices. Increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage also result from fabrication capacity expansions, either by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization, or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory and storage production. Our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply. We, and some of our competitors, have plans to ramp, or are constructing or ramping, production at new fabrication facilities. Increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage, if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand, could lead to declines in average selling prices for our products and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Additionally, rapid technological change in markets we serve could contribute to shortened product life cycles and a decline in average selling prices of our products. If competitors are more successful at developing or implementing new product or process technology, their products could have cost or performance advantages. Manufacturing We manufacture our products within our own facilities located in Taiwan, Singapore, Japan, the United States, Malaysia, China, and India and also utilize subcontractors to perform certain manufacturing processes. Our products are manufactured on 300mm wafers in facilities that generally operate 24 hours per day, seven days per week. Semiconductor manufacturing is capital intensive, requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment. Our DRAM, NAND, and NOR products share a number of common manufacturing processes, enabling us to leverage our product and process technology and certain resources and manufacturing infrastructure across these product lines. 11 | 2024 10-K Table of Contents Our process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex and involves numerous precise steps, including wafer fabrication, post fabrication processing, assembly, and test. Efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effectively deploying those techniques across multiple facilities. The primary determinants of manufacturing cost are process line-width, 3D non-volatile layers, NAND cell levels, process complexity (including the number of mask layers and fabrication steps), and manufacturing yield. Other factors include the cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment, equipment utilization, cost of raw materials, labor productivity and cost, package type, cleanliness of our manufacturing environment, and utilization of subcontractors to perform certain manufacturing processes. As we continue to increase our production of high value products and solutions, manufacturing costs are increasingly affected by the costs of application-specific integrated circuit controllers and other semiconductors, advanced and complex packaging configurations, and testing at progressively higher performance speeds and quality levels. We continuously enhance our production processes, increase bits per wafer, transition to higher density products, and utilize advanced testing and assembly processes. Wafer fabrication occurs in a highly-controlled clean environment to minimize yield loss from contaminants. Despite stringent manufacturing controls, individual circuits may be nonfunctional or wafers may be scrapped due to equipment errors, minute impurities in materials, defects in photomasks, circuit design marginalities or defects, or contamination from airborne particles, among other factors. Success of our manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects and improving process margin to maximize yield of high-quality circuits. In this regard, we employ rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing, screening, and testing processes. We continue to heighten quality control as our product offerings expand into higher-end segments that require increasing performance targets. Our products are manufactured and sold in both packaged form and as unpackaged bare die. Our packaged products include packaged die, memory modules, and system-level solutions, such as SSDs, managed NAND, and MCPs. We assemble many products in-house and, in some cases, outsource assembly services for certain packaged die, memory modules, SSDs, and MCPs. We test our products at various stages in the manufacturing process, conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow, and perform high temperature burn-in on finished products. In addition, we use our proprietary AMBYX™ line of intelligent test and burn-in systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of semiconductor die, capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost. In recent years, we have produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products and system solutions, which enhances our ability to allocate resources to our most profitable products but also increases the complexity of our manufacturing and supply chain operations. Although our product lines generally use similar manufacturing processes, our costs can be affected by frequent conversions to new products; the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex, smaller-volume products; and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity across various product lines. We have commenced expansion of our production capacity in the United States and in other regions where we operate. Semiconductor fabs are complex, capital-intensive projects and require specialized knowledge, expertise, experience, and skill sets to construct and operate. Our construction projects are highly dependent on available sources of materials, and specialized equipment, as well as labor, skilled sub-contractors and other service providers. Increasing demand, supply constraints, inflation, and other market conditions could result in shortages and higher costs. Additionally, difficulties in obtaining labor, skilled sub-contractors and other service providers or other resources could result in delays in completion of our construction projects and cost increases, including costs to operate these facilities. In the United States and in certain other regions, fab building has been uncommon in recent years. Concurrent semiconductor expansion projects across the industry introduce significant competition for the limited pool of construction talent with requisite expertise and experience in these regions. As such, expanding production capacity in the United States and certain other regions may introduce more challenges than we would experience in geographies with more established ecosystems. 12 Table of Contents Resources Supply Chain, Materials, and Third-Party Service Providers Our supply chain and operations are dependent on the availability of materials that meet exacting standards and the use of third parties to provide us with components and services. We generally have multiple sources of supply for our materials and services. However, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain materials, components, and services that meet our standards and, in some cases, materials, components, or services are provided by a single or sole source, and we may be unable to qualify new suppliers on a timely basis. The availability of materials or components such as chemicals, silicon wafers, gases, photoresist, controllers, substrates, lead frames, printed circuit boards, targets, and reticle glass blanks is impacted by various factors. These factors could include a shortage of raw materials or a disruption in the processing or purification of those raw materials into finished goods. Shortages or increases in lead times have occurred in the past, are currently occurring with respect to some materials and components, and may occur from time to time in the future. Constraints within our supply chain for certain materials and integrated circuit components could limit our bit shipments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Our manufacturing processes are also dependent on our relationships with third-party manufacturers of controllers, analog integrated circuits, and other components used in some of our products and with outsourced semiconductor foundries, assembly and test providers, contract manufacturers, logistics carriers, and other service providers, including providers of maintenance for our advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment and providers of electricity and other utilities. Although we have certain long-term contracts with some of our suppliers, many of these contracts do not provide for long-term capacity or pricing commitments. To the extent we do not have firm commitments from our third-party suppliers over a specific time period or for any specific capacity, quantity, and/or pricing, our suppliers may allocate capacity to their other customers and capacity and/or materials may not be available when needed or at reasonable prices. Inflationary pressures may continue to increase costs for materials, supplies, and services. Regardless of contract structure, large swings in demand may exceed our contracted supply and/or our suppliers’ capacity to meet those demand changes resulting in a shortage of parts, materials, or capacity needed to manufacture our products. In addition, if any of our suppliers were to cease operations or become insolvent, this could impact their ability to provide us with necessary supplies, and we may not be able to obtain the needed supply in a timely way or at all from other providers. Certain materials are primarily available in a limited number of countries, including rare earth elements, minerals, and metals. Trade disputes, geopolitical tensions, economic circumstances, political conditions, or public health issues may limit our ability to obtain such materials. Although these rare earth and other materials are generally available from multiple suppliers, China is the predominant producer of these materials. If China were to restrict or stop exporting these materials, our suppliers’ ability to obtain such supply may be constrained, and we may be unable to obtain sufficient quantities, or obtain supply in a timely manner, or at a commercially reasonable cost. Constrained supply of rare earth elements, minerals, and metals may restrict our ability to manufacture certain of our products and make it difficult or impossible to compete with other semiconductor memory and storage manufacturers who are able to obtain sufficient quantities of these materials from China. We and/or our suppliers and service providers could be affected by regional conflicts, civil unrest, labor disruptions, sanctions, tariffs, embargoes, or other trade restrictions, as well as laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change, conflict minerals, responsible sourcing practices, public health crises, or other matters, which could limit the supply of our materials and/or increase the cost. Environmental regulations could limit our ability to procure or use certain chemicals or materials in our operations or products. In addition, disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of materials. Our ability to procure components to repair equipment essential for our manufacturing processes could also be negatively impacted by various restrictions or disruptions in supply chains, among other items. The disruption of our supply of materials, components, or services, or the extension of our lead times could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Our operations are dependent on a reliable and uninterrupted supply of electrical power and water to our manufacturing facilities. Any power shortages, capacity constraints, prolonged outages, or significant or unexpected increases in the cost of power could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 13 | 2024 10-K Table of Contents Our inability to source materials, supplies, capital equipment, or third-party services could affect our overall production output and our ability to fulfill customer demand. Significant or prolonged shortages of our products could halt customer manufacturing and damage our relationships with these customers. Any damage to our customer relationships as a result of a shortage of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Similarly, if our customers experience disruptions to their supplies, materials, components, or services, or the extension of their lead times, they may reduce, cancel, or alter the timing of their purchases with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Patents and Licenses As of August 29, 2024, we owned approximately 14,500 active U.S. patents and 7,000 active foreign patents. In addition, we have thousands of U.S. and foreign patent applications pending. Our patents have various terms expiring through 2043. From time to time, we sell and/or license our technology to other parties and continue to pursue opportunities to monetize our investments in our intellectual property through partnering and other arrangements. We have also jointly developed memory and storage product and process technology with third parties on a limited basis. We have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements and have, from time to time, licensed or sold our intellectual property to third parties. Some of these license agreements require us to make one-time or periodic payments while others have resulted in us receiving payments. We may need to obtain additional licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future, and we may enter into additional sales or licenses of intellectual property and partnering arrangements. We are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on terms acceptable to us. Research and Development Our R&D efforts are focused primarily on development of memory and storage solutions, including our industry-leading DRAM and NAND technology, that enable continuous improvement in performance and cost structure for our products. Our 1-gamma DRAM pilot production using EUV lithography is progressing well, and we are on track for volume production in calendar 2025. We have begun volume production on our Micron G9 NAND node, and expect to introduce several industry-leading products over the coming quarters. We are well-positioned with our industry leading HBM3E technology. We are also focused on developing new and fundamentally different memory structures, materials, and packages designed to facilitate our transition to next generation products. Additional R&D efforts are concentrated on the enablement of advanced computing, storage, and mobile memory architectures and the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise. Product design and development efforts include HBM, DDR5, LPDDR5, high-capacity MRDIMMs, CXL based products, and advanced graphics DRAM; TLC and QLC NAND technologies; mobile and storage solutions (including firmware and controllers) in managed NAND and SSDs; and other memory technologies and systems. To compete in the semiconductor memory and storage markets, we must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes. The continued evolution of our semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected customer requirements for memory and storage products and solutions. Our process, design, firmware, controller, package, and system development efforts occur at multiple locations across the world. Our primary R&D centers are located in Boise, Idaho; San Jose, California; India; Japan; Taiwan; China; Italy; Singapore; Germany; Malaysia; and other sites in the United States. 14 Table of Contents R&D expenses vary primarily with the number of development and pre-qualification wafers processed and end-product solutions developed, personnel costs, and the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development, such as investments in EUV lithography equipment. Because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products, we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing. Development of a product is deemed complete when it is qualified through internal reviews and tests for performance, functionality, and reliability. R&D expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification and the scope of the product. Human Capital We depend on a highly educated and experienced workforce to design, develop, and manufacture high-quality, cutting-edge memory and storage solutions. As of August 29, 2024, we had approximately 48,000 employees located primarily in Asia, the United States, and Europe of which 31% were women.

We have experienced significant volatility in our average selling prices and may continue to experience such volatility in the future. In the past five years, annual percentage changes in DRAM average selling prices have ranged from plus low-teen percentage range to a minus high-40% range. In the past five years, annual percentage changes in NAND average selling prices have ranged from plus low-30% to a minus low-50% range. In some prior periods, average selling prices for our products have been below our manufacturing costs and we may experience such circumstances in the future. Average selling prices for our products that decline faster than our costs have recently had an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and in future periods could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Our gross margins may be adversely affected by a range of factors. In addition to the impact of our average selling prices, our gross margins are dependent, in part, upon continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes and product designs. Factors that may limit our ability to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to prevent deterioration of or improve gross margins include, but are not limited to: • strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix; • increasing complexity of our product portfolio, which may impact operational costs; • increasing complexity of manufacturing processes; • difficulties in transitioning to smaller line-width process technologies or additional 3D memory layers or NAND cell levels; • process complexity including number of mask layers and fabrication steps; • manufacturing yield; • technological barriers; • changes in process technologies; • new products that may require relatively larger die sizes or advanced packaging technologies; • start-up or other costs associated with capacity expansions; • higher costs of goods and services due to inflationary pressures or market conditions; and • higher manufacturing costs per gigabit due to fabrication facility underutilization, lower wafer output, and insufficient volume to run new technology nodes to achieve cost optimization. Many factors may result in a reduction of our output or a delay in ramping production, which could lead to underutilization of our production assets. These factors may include, among others, a weak demand environment, industry oversupply, inventory surpluses, difficulties in ramping emerging technologies, supply chain disruptions, and delays from equipment suppliers. See “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Overview – Industry Conditions” for information regarding recent underutilization charges. A significant portion of our manufacturing costs are fixed and do not vary proportionally with changes in production output. As a result, lower utilization, lower wafer output, and corresponding increases in our per gigabit manufacturing costs could result in higher inventory carrying costs, and have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our gross margins, business, results of operations, or financial condition. We have a broad portfolio of products to address our customers’ needs, which span multiple market segments and are subject to rapid technological changes. Our manufacturing costs on a per gigabit basis vary across our portfolio as they are largely influenced by the technology node in which the solution was developed. We strive to balance our demand and supply for each technology node, but the dynamics of our markets and our customers can create periods of imbalance, which can lead us to carry elevated inventory levels. Consequently, we may incur charges in connection with obsolete or excess inventories, or we may not fully recover our costs, which would reduce our gross margins. For example, in 2023, we recorded aggregate charges of $1.83 billion to write down the carrying value of our inventories to their estimated net realizable value. In addition, due to the customized nature of certain products we manufacture, we may be unable to sell certain finished goods inventories to alternative customers or manufacture in-process inventory to different specifications, which may result in excess and obsolescence charges in future periods. 22 Table of Contents In addition, if we are unable to supply products that meet customer design and performance specifications, we may be required to sell such products at lower average selling prices, which may reduce our gross margins. Our gross margins may also be impacted by shifts in product mix, driven by our strategy to optimize our portfolio to best respond to changing market dynamics. We may not be able to predict or quickly respond to trends in the dynamics of our markets and our customers or changes in customer demand, which could negatively impact our gross margin. Our inability to prevent deterioration of or improve gross margins could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. We face geopolitical and other risks associated with our international operations that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. In addition to our U.S. operations, a substantial portion of our operations are conducted in Taiwan, Singapore, Japan, Malaysia, China, and India, and many of our customers, suppliers, and vendors also operate internationally. In 2024, nearly half of our revenue was from sales to customers who have headquarters located outside the United States, while over 80% of our revenue in 2024 was from products shipped to customer locations outside the United States. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks, including: • restrictions on sales of goods or services to one or more of our significant foreign customers; • export and import duties, changes to import and export regulations, customs regulations and processes, and restrictions on the transfer of funds, including currency controls in China, which could negatively affect the amount and timing of payments from certain of our customers and, as a result, our cash flows; • compliance with U.S. and international laws involving international operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, sanctions and anti-corruption laws, export and import laws, and similar rules and regulations; • theft of intellectual property; • political and economic instability, including instability resulting from domestic and international conflicts; • government actions or civil unrest preventing the flow of products and materials, including delays in shipping and obtaining products and materials, cancellation of orders, or loss or damage of products; • problems with the transportation or delivery of products and materials; • issues arising from cultural or language differences and labor unrest; • longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; • compliance with trade, technical standards, and other laws in a variety of jurisdictions; • contractual and regulatory limitations on the ability to maintain flexibility with staffing levels; • disruptions to manufacturing or R&D activities as a result of actions imposed by foreign governments; • changes in economic policies of foreign governments; • difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and • public health issues. If we or our customers, suppliers, or vendors are impacted by any of these risks, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Following the May 2023 decision of its cybersecurity review of our products sold in China, the CAC determined that critical information infrastructure operators in China may not purchase Micron products, impacting our revenue with companies headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong, including direct sales as well as indirect sales through distributors. Further actions by the Chinese government, through CAC action or other means, could impact revenue inside or outside China, or our operations in China, or our ability to ship products to our customers, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 23 | 2024 10-K Table of Contents In addition, the U.S. government has in the past and continues to restrict American firms, including us, from selling products and software to certain of our customers and may in the future impose similar restrictions on one or more of our significant customers. These restrictions may not prohibit our competitors from selling similar products to our customers, which may result in our loss of sales and market share. Even as such restrictions are lifted, financial or other penalties or continuing export restrictions imposed with respect to our customers could have a continuing negative impact on our future revenue and results of operations, and we may not be able to recover any customers or market share we lose, or make such recoveries at acceptable average selling prices, while complying with such restrictions. Political, economic, or other actions may adversely affect our operations in Taiwan. A majority of our DRAM production output in 2024 was from our fabrication facilities in Taiwan, and any loss of output could have a material adverse effect on us. Any political, economic, or other actions may also adversely affect our customers and the technology industry supply chain, for which Taiwan is a central hub, and as a result, could have a material adverse impact on us. The semiconductor memory and storage markets are highly competitive. We face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets from a number of companies, including Kioxia Holdings Corporation; Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.; SK hynix Inc.; and Western Digital Corporation. Our competitors may use aggressive pricing to obtain market share. Some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have a larger market share and greater resources to invest in technology, capitalize on growth opportunities, and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete. Consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage as our competitors may benefit from increased manufacturing scale and a stronger product portfolio. We operate in different jurisdictions than our competitors and may be impacted by unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. In addition, some governments may provide, or have provided and may continue to provide, significant assistance, financial or otherwise, to some of our competitors or to new entrants and may intervene in support of national industries and/or competitors. In particular, we face the threat of increasing competition as a result of significant investment in the semiconductor industry by the Chinese government and various state-owned or affiliated entities, in companies such as Yangtze Memory Technologies Co., Ltd. (“YMTC”) and ChangXin Memory Technologies, Inc. (“CXMT”). In addition, the CAC’s decision that critical information infrastructure operators in China may not purchase Micron products had an adverse impact on our ability to compete effectively in China and elsewhere. We and our competitors generally seek to increase supply to address growing market demands, improve yields, and reduce die size, which could result in significant increases in worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices. Increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage also result from fabrication capacity expansions, either by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization, or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory and storage production. Our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply. We, and some of our competitors, have plans to ramp, or are constructing or ramping, production at new fabrication facilities. Increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage, if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand, could lead to declines in average selling prices for our products and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Additionally, rapid technological change in markets we serve could contribute to shortened product life cycles and a decline in average selling prices of our products. If competitors are more successful at developing or implementing new product or process technology, their products could have cost or performance advantages. The competitive nature of our industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 24 Table of Contents Our future success depends on our ability to develop and produce new and competitive memory and storage technologies and products. Our key semiconductor memory and storage technologies face technological barriers to continue to meet long-term customer needs. These barriers include achieving acceptable yields and quality for HBM products with their multiple memory chip layers, potential limitations on stacking additional 3D memory layers, increasing bits per cell (i.e., cell levels), meeting higher density requirements, developing advanced packaging solutions, improving power consumption and reliability, and delivering advanced features and higher performance. We may face technological barriers to continue to shrink our products at our current or historical rate, which has generally reduced per gigabit cost. We have invested and expect to continue to invest in R&D for new and existing products and process technologies, such as EUV lithography, to continue to deliver advanced product requirements. Such new technologies can add complexity and risk to our schedule and may affect our costs and production output. We may be unable to recover our investment in R&D or otherwise realize the economic benefits of reducing die size or increasing memory and storage densities. Our competitors are working to develop new memory and storage technologies that may offer performance and/or cost advantages to existing technologies and render existing technologies obsolete. Accordingly, our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce viable and competitive new memory and storage technologies. We are developing new products, including system-level memory and storage products and solutions, which complement our traditional products or leverage their underlying design or process technology. We have invested and expect to continue to invest in new semiconductor product and system-level solution development. We are increasingly differentiating our products and solutions to meet the specific demands of our customers, which increases our reliance on our customers’ ability to accurately forecast the needs and preferences of their customers. Recent technologies, such as generative AI models have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for HBM and other advanced products in the data center and other markets, the long-term trajectory is unknown and associated demand may fluctuate. As a result, our product demand forecasts may be impacted significantly by the strategic actions of our customers. In addition, our ability to successfully introduce new products often requires us to make product specification decisions multiple years in advance of when new products enter the market. It is important that we deliver products in a timely manner with increasingly advanced performance characteristics at the time our customers are designing and evaluating samples for their products. If we do not meet their product design schedules, our customers may exclude us from further consideration as a supplier for those products. The process to develop new products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality, performance, and reliability, often well in advance of a planned ramp of production, in order to secure design wins with our customers. Many factors may negatively impact our ability to meet anticipated timelines and/or expected or required quality standards with respect to the development of certain of our products. In addition, some of our components have long lead-times, requiring us to place orders up to a year in advance of anticipated demand. Such long lead-times increase the risk of excess inventory or loss of sales in the event our forecasts vary substantially from actual demand. There can be no assurance of the following: • we will be successful in developing competitive new semiconductor memory and storage technologies and products; • we will be able to cost-effectively manufacture new products; • we will be able to successfully market these technologies; • margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts; • we will be able to establish or maintain key relationships with customers, or that we will not be prohibited from working with certain customers, for specific chip set or design requirements; • we will accurately predict and design products that meet our customers' specifications; or • we will be able to introduce new products into the market and qualify them with our customers on a timely basis. Unsuccessful efforts to develop new memory and storage technologies and products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 25 | 2024 10-K Table of Contents We may not be able to achieve expected returns from capacity expansions. We have commenced expansion of our production capacity in the United States and in other regions where we operate. Semiconductor fabs are complex, capital-intensive projects and require specialized knowledge, expertise, experience, and skill sets to construct and operate. Our construction projects are highly dependent on available sources of materials, and specialized equipment, as well as labor, skilled sub-contractors and other service providers. Increasing demand, supply constraints, inflation, and other market conditions could result in shortages and higher costs. Additionally, difficulties in obtaining labor, skilled sub-contractors and other service providers or other resources could result in delays in completion of our construction projects and cost increases, including costs to operate these facilities. In the United States and in certain other regions, fab building has been uncommon in recent years. Concurrent semiconductor expansion projects across the industry introduce significant competition for the limited pool of construction talent with requisite expertise and experience in these regions. As such, expanding production capacity in the United States and certain other regions may introduce more challenges than we would experience in geographies with more established ecosystems. In addition, these expansions involve several risks including the following: • inability to meet capital expenditure requirements for capacity expansions, including during periods of relatively low free cash flow generation, resulting from challenging memory and storage industry conditions; • unavailability of necessary funding, which may include external sources; • inability to realize expected grants, investment tax credits, and other government incentives, including through the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 (“CHIPS Act”) and other national, international, state, and local grants; • potential changes in laws or provisions of grants, investment tax credits, and other government incentives; • delays and potential restrictions related to environmental regulations or permits; • potential restrictions on expanding in certain geographies; • inability to complete construction as scheduled and within budget; • inability to attract, retain and motivate key talent; • inability to timely ramp production in a cost-effective manner; • increases to our cost structure until new production is ramped to adequate scale; and • insufficient customer demand to utilize our increased capacity. From time to time, we have experienced the impacts from the above items and, because these risks are a characteristic of our business, we expect to experience them in the future. Depending on the nature and extent of the impact from these risks, we may be unable to produce sufficient capacity in the expected time frame which could result in delays in the completion of our construction projects and increased costs, including costs to operate these facilities. We invest our capital in areas that we believe best align with our business strategy and optimize future returns. Investments in capital expenditures may not generate expected returns or cash flows. Significant judgment is required to determine which capital investments will result in optimal returns, and we could invest in projects that are ultimately less profitable than those projects we do not select. Delays in completion and ramping of new production facilities, or failure to optimize our investment choices, could significantly impact our ability to realize expected returns on our capital expenditures. Any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 26 Table of Contents Our incentives from various governments are conditioned upon achieving or maintaining certain outcomes and the compliance requirements and are subject to reduction, termination, clawback, or could impose certain limitations on our business. We have received, and may in the future continue to receive, benefits and incentives from national, state, and local governments in various regions of the world designed to encourage us to establish, maintain, or increase investment, workforce, research and development, or production in those regions. Our future business plans are impacted by obtaining these government incentives, which may take various forms, including grants, subsidies, loans, and tax arrangements, and typically require us to achieve or maintain certain levels of investment, capital spending, employment, technology deployment or development milestones, construction or production milestones, or research and development activities to qualify for such incentives or could restrict us from undertaking certain activities. In some cases, these incentives have additional terms and conditions regarding our business operations or governance that are required to be satisfied as a condition to receive incentives or disbursements. Compliance with these terms and conditions may add complexity to our operations and increase our costs. We may be unable to obtain sufficient future incentives to continue to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and operating costs, without which our cost structure may be adversely impacted and planned capital expenditures and research and development expenditures may be affected. For example, we have signed a non-binding preliminary memorandum of terms with the U.S. Department of Commerce to receive a grant under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 (“CHIPS Act”). These preliminary terms may not result in us receiving funding. We also cannot guarantee that we will successfully achieve or maintain outcomes or satisfy the compliance requirements to qualify for these incentives or that the granting agencies will provide or continue to provide such funding. These incentive arrangements typically provide the granting agencies with rights to audit our compliance with their terms and obligations. Such audits could result in modifications to, or termination of, the applicable incentive program. The incentives we receive could be subject to reduction, termination, or clawback, and any decrease or clawback of government incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be adversely affected by the availability and quality of materials, supplies, electrical power, water, and capital equipment, or dependency on third-party service providers. Our supply chain and operations are dependent on the availability of materials that meet exacting standards and the use of third parties to provide us with components and services. We generally have multiple sources of supply for our materials and services. However, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain materials, components, and services that meet our standards and, in some cases, materials, components, or services are provided by a single or sole source, and we may be unable to qualify new suppliers on a timely basis. The availability of materials or components such as chemicals, silicon wafers, gases, photoresist, controllers, substrates, lead frames, printed circuit boards, targets, and reticle glass blanks is impacted by various factors. These factors could include a shortage of raw materials or a disruption in the processing or purification of those raw materials into finished goods. Shortages or increases in lead times have occurred in the past, are currently occurring with respect to some materials and components, and may occur from time to time in the future because of the nature of the industry. Constraints within our supply chain for certain materials and integrated circuit components could limit our bit shipments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 27 | 2024 10-K Table of Contents Our manufacturing processes are also dependent on our relationships with third-party manufacturers of controllers, analog integrated circuits, and other components used in some of our products and with outsourced semiconductor foundries, assembly and test providers, contract manufacturers, logistics carriers, and other service providers, including providers of maintenance for our advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment and providers of electricity and other utilities. Although we have certain long-term contracts with some of our suppliers, many of these contracts do not provide for long-term capacity or pricing commitments. To the extent we do not have firm commitments from our third-party suppliers over a specific time period or for any specific capacity, quantity, and/or pricing, our suppliers may allocate capacity to their other customers and capacity and/or materials may not be available when needed or at reasonable prices. Inflationary pressures may continue to increase costs for materials, supplies, and services. Regardless of contract structure, large swings in demand may exceed our contracted supply and/or our suppliers’ capacity to meet those demand changes resulting in a shortage of parts, materials, or capacity needed to manufacture our products. In addition, if any of our suppliers were to cease operations or become insolvent, this could impact their ability to provide us with necessary supplies, and we may not be able to obtain the needed supply in a timely way or at all from other providers. Certain materials are primarily available in a limited number of countries, including rare earth elements, minerals, and metals. Trade disputes, geopolitical tensions, economic circumstances, political conditions, or public health issues may limit our ability to obtain such materials. Although these rare earth and other materials are generally available from multiple suppliers, China is the predominant producer of these materials. If China were to restrict or stop exporting these materials, our suppliers’ ability to obtain such supply may be constrained, and we may be unable to obtain sufficient quantities, or obtain supply in a timely manner, or at a commercially reasonable cost. Constrained supply of rare earth elements, minerals, and metals may restrict our ability to manufacture certain of our products and make it difficult or impossible to compete with other semiconductor memory and storage manufacturers who are able to obtain sufficient quantities of these materials from China. We and/or our suppliers and service providers could be affected by regional conflicts, civil unrest, labor disruptions, sanctions, tariffs, embargoes, or other trade restrictions, as well as laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change, conflict minerals, responsible sourcing practices, public health crises, or other matters, which could limit the supply of our materials and/or increase the cost. Environmental regulations could limit our ability to procure or use certain chemicals or materials in our operations or products. In addition, disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of materials. Our ability to procure components to repair equipment essential for our manufacturing processes could also be negatively impacted by various restrictions or disruptions in supply chains, among other items. The disruption of our supply of materials, components, or services, or the extension of our lead times could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Our operations are dependent on a reliable and uninterrupted supply of electrical power and water to our manufacturing facilities. Any power shortages, capacity constraints, prolonged outages, or significant or unexpected increases in the cost of power could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Our operations are dependent on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment that enables the transition to lower cost manufacturing processes. For certain key types of equipment, including photolithography tools, we are sometimes dependent on a single supplier. From time to time, we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to suppliers’ limited capacity. Our inability to obtain equipment on a timely basis could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing processes and reduce our costs. Delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production and could increase our overall costs of a ramp. Our inability to obtain advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Our construction projects to expand production and R&D capacity are highly dependent on available sources of labor, materials, equipment, and services. Increasing demand, supply constraints, inflation, and other market conditions could result in increasing shortages and higher costs for these items. Difficulties in obtaining these resources could result in delays in completion of our construction projects and cost increases, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 28 Table of Contents Our inability to source materials, supplies, capital equipment, or third-party services could affect our overall production output and our ability to fulfill customer demand. Significant or prolonged shortages of our products could halt customer manufacturing and damage our relationships with these customers. Any damage to our customer relationships as a result of a shortage of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Similarly, if our customers experience disruptions to their supplies, materials, components, or services, or the extension of their lead times, they may reduce, cancel, or alter the timing of their purchases with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Downturns in regional or worldwide economies may harm our business. Downturns in regional or worldwide economies, due to inflation, geopolitics, major central bank policy actions including interest rate increases, public health crises, or other factors, have harmed our business in the past and current and future downturns could also adversely affect our business. Adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that incorporate our products, such as personal computers, smartphones, automobiles, and servers. Reduced demand for these or other products could result in significant decreases in our average selling prices and product sales. In addition, to the extent our customers or distributors have elevated inventory levels or are impacted by a deterioration in credit markets, we may experience a decrease in short-term and/or long-term demand resulting in industry oversupply and declines in pricing for our products. A deterioration of conditions in regional or worldwide credit markets could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures. In addition, we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties. Difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivable due to credit defaults. Additionally, our current or potential future customers may experience cash flow problems and as a result may modify, delay, or cancel plans to purchase our products. Any inability of our current or potential future customers to pay us for our products may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow. As a result, downturns in regional or worldwide economies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. If our manufacturing process is disrupted by operational issues, natural disasters, or other events, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. We and our subcontractors manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance. Difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs. We and our subcontractors maintain operations and continuously implement new product and process technology at manufacturing facilities, which are widely dispersed in multiple locations in several countries including the United States, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, Malaysia, and China. As a result of the necessary interdependence within our network of manufacturing facilities, an operational disruption at one of our or a subcontractor’s facilities may have a disproportionate impact on our ability to produce many of our products. From time to time, there have been disruptions in our manufacturing operations as a result of power outages, improperly functioning equipment, disruptions in supply of raw materials or components, or equipment failures. We have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences and possible climate changes, such as severe and variable weather and geological events resulting in increased costs, or disruptions to our manufacturing operations or those of our suppliers or customers. In addition, climate change may pose physical risks to our manufacturing facilities or our suppliers’ facilities, including increased extreme weather events that could result in supply delays or disruptions. Other events, including political or public health crises, such as an outbreak of contagious diseases, may also affect our production capabilities or that of our suppliers, including as a result of quarantines, closures of production facilities, lack of supplies, or delays caused by restrictions on travel or shipping. Events of the types noted above have occurred from time to time and, because these risks are a characteristic of our business, they may occur in the future. As a result, in addition to disruptions to operations, our insurance premiums may increase or we may not be able to fully recover any sustained losses through insurance. 29 | 2024 10-K Table of Contents If production is disrupted for any reason, manufacturing yields may be adversely affected, or we may be unable to meet our customers’ requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers. This could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs, loss of revenue, or damage to customer relationships, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. A significant portion of our revenue is concentrated with a select number of customers. Approximately one-half of our total revenue comes from our top ten customers. A disruption in our relationship with any of these customers could adversely affect our business. We could experience fluctuations in our customer base or the mix of revenue by customer as markets and strategies evolve. Our customers’ demand for our products may fluctuate due to factors beyond our control. In addition, any consolidation of our customers could reduce the number of customers to whom our products may be sold. Our inability to meet our customers’ requirements or to qualify our products with them could adversely impact our revenue. A meaningful change in the inventory strategy of our customers could impact our industry bit demand growth outlook. The loss of, or restrictions on our ability to sell to, one or more of our major customers, or any significant reduction in orders from, or a shift in product mix by, customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Increases in sales of system solutions may increase our dependency upon specific customers and our costs to develop, qualify, and manufacture our system solutions. Our development of system-level memory and storage products is dependent, in part, upon successfully identifying and meeting our customers’ specifications for those products. Developing and manufacturing system-level products with specifications unique to a customer increases our reliance upon that customer for purchasing our products at sufficient volumes and prices in a timely manner. Even if our products meet customer specifications, our sales of system-level solutions are dependent upon our customers choosing our products over those of our competitors and purchasing our products at sufficient volumes and prices. Our competitors’ products may be less costly, provide better performance, or include additional features when compared to our products. Our long-term ability to sell system-level memory and storage products is reliant upon our customers’ ability to create, market, and sell their products containing our system-level solutions at sufficient volumes and prices in a timely manner. If we fail to successfully develop and market system-level products, our business, results of operations, or financial condition may be materially adversely affected. Manufacturing system-level solutions, such as SSDs, managed NAND, and HBM, typically results in higher per-unit manufacturing costs as compared to other products. Even if we are successful in selling system-level solutions to our customers in sufficient volume, we may be unable to generate sufficient profit if our per-unit manufacturing costs are not offset by higher per-unit selling prices. Manufacturing system-level solutions to customer specifications requires a longer development cycle, as compared to discrete products, to design, test, and qualify, which may increase our costs. Some of our system solutions are increasingly dependent on sophisticated firmware that may require significant customization to meet customer specifications, which increases our costs and time to market. Additionally, we may need to update our controller and hardware design as well as our firmware or develop new firmware as a result of new product introductions or changes in customer specifications and/or industry standards, which increases our costs. System complexities and extended warranties for system-level products could also increase our warranty costs. Our failure to cost-effectively manufacture system-level solutions and/or controller, hardware design, and firmware in a timely manner may result in reduced demand for our system-level products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 30 Table of Contents Products that fail to meet specifications, are defective, or are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us. Products that do not meet specifications or that contain, or are perceived by our customers to contain, defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. From time to time, we experience problems with nonconforming, defective, or incompatible products after we have shipped such products. In recent periods, we have further diversified and expanded our product offerings, which could potentially increase the chance that one or more of our products could fail to meet specifications in a particular application. Our products and solutions may be deemed fully or partially responsible for functionality in our customers’ products and may result in sharing or shifting of product or financial liability from our customers to us for costs incurred by the end user as a result of our customers’ products failing to perform as specified. In addition, if our products and solutions perform critical functions in our customers’ products or are used in high-risk consumer end products, such as autonomous driver assistance programs, home and enterprise security, smoke and noxious gas detectors, medical monitoring equipment, or wearables for child and elderly safety, our potential liability may increase. We could be adversely affected in several ways, including the following: • we may be required or agree to compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible products and to replace products; • we could incur a decrease in revenue or adjustment to pricing commensurate with the reimbursement of such costs or alleged damages; and • we may encounter adverse publicity, which could cause a decrease in sales of our products or harm our reputation or relationships with existing or potential customers. Any of the foregoing items could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 31 | 2024 10-K Table of Contents Breaches of our security systems or products, systems failures, interruptions, delays in service, catastrophic events, and resulting interruptions in the availability of our systems or those of our customers, suppliers, or business partners, could expose us to losses. We maintain a system of controls over the physical security of our facilities. We also manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations. In addition, we process, store, and transmit data relating to our customers and employees, including sensitive personal information. Unauthorized persons, employees, former employees, nation states, or other parties may gain access to our facilities or technology infrastructure and systems through fraudulent means and may steal trade secrets or other proprietary information, compromise confidential information, create system disruptions, or have other impacts. This risk is exacerbated as competitors for talent, particularly engineering talent, attempt to hire our employees. Through cyberattacks on technology infrastructure and systems, unauthorized parties may obtain access to computer systems, networks, and data, including cloud-based platforms. Our technology infrastructure and systems and that of our suppliers, vendors, service providers, cloud solution providers, and partners have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, such attacks, which could impact our operations. Cyberattacks can include ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, zero-day attacks, supply chain attacks, “phishing” and other forms of social engineering, exploitation of open source software vulnerabilities, and other malicious software programs or other attacks, including those using techniques that change frequently or may be disguised or difficult to detect, or designed to remain dormant until a triggering event, impersonation of authorized users, and efforts to discover and exploit any design flaws, “bugs,” security vulnerabilities, as well as intentional or unintentional acts by employees or other insiders with access privileges. The emergence and maturation of AI capabilities may also lead to new and/or more sophisticated methods of attack. Globally, cyberattacks are increasing in number and the attackers are increasingly organized and well-financed, or supported by state actors, and are developing increasingly sophisticated systems to not only attack, but also to evade detection. In addition, geopolitical tensions or conflicts may create a heightened risk of cyberattacks. Breaches of our physical security, including break-ins, sabotage or vandalism, attacks on our technology infrastructure and systems, security breaches or incidents, or attacks on our customers, suppliers, or business partners who maintain or otherwise process confidential or sensitive information regarding us and our customers and suppliers, could result in damage to, or loss, disruption, or unavailability of data or systems, or inappropriate disclosure, destruction, loss, or other processing of confidential or sensitive information. In addition, our systems and those of our third-party vendors may experience service interruptions, data loss or compromise and outages, for other reasons, including human error, pandemics, fires, other natural disasters, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks and other geopolitical unrest, computer viruses, ransomware, and other malicious software, changes in social, political, or regulatory conditions or in laws and policies, or other changes or events. Any such event, or the perception it has occurred, may result in significant losses and damage our reputation with customers and suppliers and may expose us to claims, demands, and litigation. Systems and applications that incorporate or otherwise utilize our products are also targets for cyberattacks. While some of our products contain encryption, security algorithms, or features designed to help protect third-party content, user-generated data stored on our products, or the functionality of our products as intended, systems and applications that utilize these products could still be hacked or the encryption schemes could be compromised, breached, or circumvented by motivated and sophisticated attackers. Further, our products contain sophisticated hardware, firmware and software (some of which is provided by third parties) that may contain weaknesses or defects in design or manufacture, including “bugs” and other problems that could interfere with the intended operation of our products or be potentially exploited by such attackers. If systems or applications that utilize our products are hacked, the encryption schemes are compromised or breached, or our suppliers are breached or attacked, this could harm our business by requiring us to employ additional resources to fix the errors or defects, and could expose us to litigation, claims, and harm to our reputation. We cannot be certain that any applicable insurance coverage we maintain will be adequate or otherwise protect us with respect to claims, expenses, fines, penalties, business loss, data loss, litigation, regulatory actions, or other impacts arising from security breaches or incidents, or that such coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or at all. Any of the foregoing security risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 32 Table of Contents We may be adversely impacted by any of the multiple uncertainties and outcomes associated with the use and evolution of AI. We are increasingly incorporating AI capabilities into the development of technologies and our business operations, and into our products and services. AI technology is complex and rapidly evolving, and may expose us to significant competitive, legal, regulatory, and other risks. The implementation of AI can be costly and there is no guarantee that our use of AI will enhance our technologies, benefit our business operations, or produce products and services that are preferred by our customers. AI will likely increase or change the competitive environment in our markets. Our competitors may be more successful in their AI strategy or they may have access to greater AI resources or technology and develop superior products and services. Additionally, AI algorithms or training methodologies may be flawed, and datasets may contain irrelevant, insufficient or biased information, which can cause errors in outputs. AI is also the subject of an evolving set of legal requirements and regulations and we may be subject to new and conflicting laws and regulations. Any of these matters may give rise to legal liability, damage our reputation, and materially harm our business. We must attract, retain, and motivate highly skilled employees. To remain competitive, we must maintain a highly skilled, diverse workforce and effectively manage succession for key roles. Hiring, retaining and motivating qualified executives and other skilled talent is critical to our business and competition can be intense. If our total compensation programs, employment benefits, and workplace culture are not viewed as competitive and inclusive, our ability to attract and retain talent could be compromised. At times, we experience higher levels of attrition and more intense competition for talent across our industry, which can lead to increased compensation costs. To the extent we experience significant attrition and are unable to timely replace employees, we could experience a loss of critical skills and reduced employee morale, potentially resulting in business disruptions, inefficiencies during transitional periods and increased expenses. Additionally, changes to immigration policies in the countries in which we operate, as well as restrictions on travel due to public health crises or other causes, may limit our ability to hire and/or retain talent in, or transfer talent to, specific locations. Our business success is dependent on our ability to attract, retain and motivate key talent. Our inability to do so could inhibit our ability to maintain or expand our business operations and may adversely impact our operating results. Compliance with responsible sourcing requirements and any related regulations could increase our operating costs or limit the supply and increase the cost of certain materials, supplies, and services, and if we fail to comply, customers may reduce purchases from us or disqualify us as a supplier. We and many of our customers have adopted responsible sourcing programs that require us to meet certain environmental, social and governance criteria, and to periodically report on our performance against these requirements, including that we source the materials, supplies, and services we use and incorporate into the products we sell as prescribed by these programs. Many customer programs require us to remove a supplier within a prescribed period if such supplier ceases to comply with prescribed criteria, and our supply chain may at any time contain suppliers at risk of being removed due to non-compliance with responsible sourcing requirements. Some of our customers may elect to disqualify us as a supplier (resulting in a permanent or temporary loss of sales to such customer) or reduce purchases from us if we are unable to verify that our performance or products (including the underlying supply chain) meet the specifications of our customers’ responsible sourcing programs on a continuous basis. Meeting responsible sourcing requirements may increase operating requirements and costs or limit the sourcing and availability of some of the materials, supplies, and services we use, particularly when the availability of such materials, supplies, and services is concentrated to a limited number of suppliers. From time to time, we remove suppliers or require our suppliers to remove suppliers from their supply chains based on our responsible sourcing requirements or customer requirements, and we or our suppliers may be unable to replace such removed suppliers in a timely or cost-effective manner. Any inability to replace removed suppliers in a timely or cost effective manner may affect our ability and/or the cost to obtain sufficient quantities of materials, supplies, and services necessary for the manufacture of our products. Our inability to replace suppliers we have removed in a timely or cost-effective manner or comply with customers’ responsible sourcing requirements or with any related regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 33 | 2024 10-K Table of Contents Failure to meet environmental, social, and governance expectations or standards or achieve our related goals could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or stock price. In recent years, there has been an increased focus from stakeholders on environmental, social, and governance matters, including greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related risks, sustainability, renewable energy, water stewardship, waste management, diversity, equality and inclusion, responsible sourcing and supply chain, human rights, and social responsibility. Given our commitment to social and environmental issues as it relates to our business, we actively manage these issues and have established and publicly announced certain goals, commitments, and targets which we may refine or even expand further in the future. These goals, commitments, and targets reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. Achieving these goals may entail significant costs, for example we have entered into several virtual power purchase agreements to obtain renewable energy credits at a cost that will vary based on future prices for electrical power. Evolving stakeholder expectations and our efforts to manage these issues, report on them, and accomplish our goals present numerous operational, regulatory, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks, any of which could have a material adverse impact, including on our reputation and stock price. Such risks and uncertainties include: • reputational harm, including damage to our relationships with customers, suppliers, investors, governments, or other stakeholders; • adverse impacts on our ability to manufacture and sell products and maintain our market share; • the success of our collaborations with third parties; • increased risk of litigation, investigations, or regulatory enforcement action; • unfavorable environmental, social, and governance ratings or investor sentiment; • diversion of resources and increased costs to control, assess, and report on environmental, social, and governance metrics; • our ability to achieve our goals, commitments, and targets within timeframes announced; • increased costs to achieve our goals, commitments, and targets; • unforeseen operational and technological difficulties; • access to and increased cost of capital; and • adverse impacts on our stock price. Any failure, or perceived failure, to meet evolving stakeholder expectations and industry standards or achieve our environmental, social, and governance goals, commitments, and targets could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or stock price. 34 Table of Contents Acquisitions and/or alliances involve numerous risks. Acquisitions and the formation or operation of alliances, such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements, involve numerous risks, including the following: • integrating the operations, technologies, and products of acquired or newly formed entities into our operations; • increasing capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain facilities; • increased debt levels; • the assumption of unknown or underestimated liabilities; • the use of cash to finance a transaction, which may reduce the availability of cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures, R&D expenditures, and other business activities; • diverting management’s attention from daily operations; • managing larger or more complex operations and facilities and employees in separate and diverse geographic areas; • hiring and retaining key employees; • requirements imposed by government authorities in connection with the regulatory review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures, imposition of significant obligations, or restrictions on the conduct of our business or the acquired business; • underestimating the costs or overestimating the benefits, including product, revenue, cost and other synergies and growth opportunities that we expect to realize, and we may not achieve those benefits; • failure to maintain customer, vendor, and other relationships; • inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company’s internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, compliance programs, and/or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices; and • impairment of acquired intangible assets, goodwill, or other assets as a result of changing business conditions or technological advancements. The global memory and storage industry has experienced consolidation and may continue to consolidate. We engage, from time to time, in discussions regarding potential acquisitions and similar opportunities. To the extent we are successful in completing any such transactions, we could be subject to some or all of the risks described above. Acquisitions of, or alliances with, technology companies are inherently risky and may not be successful and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. We may incur restructure charges in future periods and may not realize expected savings or other benefits from restructure plans. From time to time, we have because of the nature of our business, and may in the future, enter into restructure initiatives in order to, among other items, streamline our operations, respond to changes in business conditions, our markets, or product offerings, or to centralize certain key functions. We may not realize expected savings or other benefits from future restructure activities and may incur additional restructure charges or other losses in future periods associated with other initiatives. In connection with any restructure initiatives, we could incur restructure charges, loss of production output, loss of key personnel, disruptions in our operations, and difficulties in the timely delivery of products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 35 | 2024 10-K Table of Contents Risks Related to Intellectual Property and Litigation We may be unable to protect our intellectual property or retain key employees who are knowledgeable of and develop our intellectual property. We maintain a system of controls over our intellectual property, including U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, licensing arrangements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with employees, consultants, and vendors, and a general system of internal controls. Despite our system of controls over our intellectual property, it may be possible for our current or future competitors to obtain, copy, use, or disclose, illegally or otherwise, our product and process technology or other proprietary information. The laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same degree as do U.S. laws, and our confidentiality, non-disclosure, and non-compete agreements may be unenforceable or difficult and costly to enforce. The use of AI in the development of our products and services could also cause loss of intellectual property, as well as subject us to risks related to intellectual property infringement or misappropriation. Additionally, our ability to maintain and develop intellectual property is dependent upon our ability to attract, develop, and retain highly skilled employees. If our competitors or future entrants into our industry are successful in hiring our employees, they may directly benefit from the knowledge these employees gained while they were under our employment, and this may also negatively impact our ability to maintain and develop intellectual property. Our inability to protect our intellectual property or retain key employees who are knowledgeable of and develop our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Legal, regulatory and administrative investigations, inquiries, proceedings, and claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. From time to time, we are subject to various legal, regulatory and administrative investigations, inquiries, proceedings, and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business or otherwise, both domestically and internationally. Such claims, investigations, inquiries, and proceedings may include, but are not limited to, allegations of anticompetitive conduct and infringement of intellectual property. See “Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Contingencies.” We may be associated with and subject to litigation, claims, inquiries, investigations or disputes arising from, or as a result of: • our relationships with vendors or customers, supply agreements, or contractual obligations with our subcontractors or business partners; • the actions of our vendors, subcontractors, or business partners; • our indemnification obligations, including obligations to defend our customers against third-party claims asserting infringement of certain intellectual property rights, which may include patents, trademarks, copyrights, or trade secrets; and • the terms of our product warranties or from product liability claims. As we continue to focus on developing system solutions with manufacturers of consumer products, including autonomous driving, augmented reality, AI, and others, we may be exposed to greater potential for personal liability claims against us as a result of consumers’ use of those products. We, our officers, or our directors could also be subject to claims of alleged violations of securities laws. Expansion of our production capacity in the United States and in other regions is subject to inherent safety risks for our employees and contractors. This expansion activity may involve accidents, which could result in project delays, litigation, claims or disputes by our contractors and others, as well as increased insurance costs. 36 Table of Contents While the risks of our construction projects are covered by insurance and contractual indemnities from our contractors, we may not have insurance coverage or rights to indemnity for all risks. Further, there can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities, and we may elect to self-insure with respect to certain matters. Exposures to various legal proceedings and claims, with or without merit, could require significant attention from our management and could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend claims, are required to pay damage awards, or enter into settlement agreements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Claims that our products or manufacturing processes infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others, or failure to obtain or renew license agreements covering such intellectual property, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. As is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries, from time to time others have asserted, and may in the future assert, that our products or manufacturing processes infringe upon, misappropriate, misuse, or otherwise violate their intellectual property rights. We are unable to predict the outcome of these assertions made against us. Any of these types of claims, regardless of the merits, could subject us to significant costs to defend or resolve such claims and may consume a substantial portion of management’s time and attention. As a result of these claims, we may be required to: • pay significant monetary damages, fines, royalties, or penalties; • enter into license or settlement agreements covering such intellectual property rights; • make material changes to or redesign our products and/or manufacturing processes; and/or • cease manufacturing, having made, selling, offering for sale, importing, marketing, or using products and/or manufacturing processes in certain jurisdictions. We may not be able to take any of the actions described above on commercially reasonable terms and any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. See “Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Contingencies.” We have a number of intellectual property license agreements. Some of these license agreements require us to make one-time or periodic payments. We may need to obtain additional licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future. We are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on terms acceptable to us. The failure to obtain or renew licenses as necessary could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Risks Related to Laws and Regulations Government actions and regulations, such as export restrictions, tariffs, and trade protection measures, may limit our ability to sell our products to certain customers or markets, or could otherwise restrict our ability to conduct operations. International trade disputes, geopolitical tensions, and military conflicts have led, and continue to lead, to new and increasing export restrictions, trade barriers, tariffs, and other trade measures that can increase our manufacturing costs, make our products less competitive, reduce demand for our products, limit our ability to sell to certain customers or markets, limit our ability to procure, or increase our costs for, components or raw materials, impede or slow the movement of our goods across borders, impede our ability to perform R&D activities, or otherwise restrict our ability to conduct operations. Increasing protectionism, economic nationalism, and national security concerns may lead to further changes in trade policy, domestic sourcing initiatives, or other formal and informal measures that could make it more difficult to sell our products in, or restrict our access to, some markets and/or customers. For example, following the May 2023 decision of its cybersecurity review of our products sold in China, the CAC determined that critical information infrastructure operators in China may not purchase Micron products, impacting our revenue with companies headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong, including direct sales as well as indirect sales through distributors. Further actions by the Chinese government, through CAC action or other means, could impact revenue inside or outside China, or our operations in China, or our ability to ship products to our customers, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 37 | 2024 10-K Table of Contents We cannot predict what actions may be taken with respect to export regulations, tariffs, or other trade regulations between the United States and other countries, what products or companies may be subject to such actions, or what actions may be taken by other countries in retaliation. Further changes in trade policy, tariffs, restrictions on exports or other trade barriers, or restrictions on supplies, equipment, and raw materials including rare earth minerals, may limit our ability to produce products, increase our selling and/or manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies. For example, increasing geopolitical tensions could result in new export controls associated with products that support or enable AI applications which could, in turn, restrict future sales of certain products to China or other markets. Such changes may also result in reputational harm to us, the development or adoption of technologies that compete with our products, long-term changes in global trade and technology supply chains, or negative impacts on our customers’ products which incorporate our solutions. Any of the effects described in this risk factor could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. The technology industry is subject to intense media, political, and regulatory scrutiny, which can increase our exposure to government investigations, legal actions, and penalties. Although we have policies, controls, and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, or agents will not violate such laws or our policies. Violations of trade laws, restrictions, or regulations can result in fines; criminal sanctions against us or our officers, directors, or employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. Tax-related matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes and cash tax liabilities in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including changes in the geographic mix of our earnings among jurisdictions, challenges by tax authorities to our tax positions and intercompany transfer pricing arrangements, failure to meet performance obligations with respect to tax incentive agreements, expanding our operations in various countries, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, adverse resolution of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns, and changes in tax laws and regulations. Changes to income tax laws and regulations, or the interpretation of such laws, in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could significantly increase our effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flows from operating activities and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project, including Pillar Two Model Rules (“Pillar Two”), undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”). Nearly all European Union member states have enacted the Pillar Two legislation, which will be effective for us in 2025. While we do not expect these enacted laws to materially impact our effective tax rate for 2025, additional countries where we operate, including Singapore, have announced plans to adopt Pillar Two legislation. Enactment of this legislation would become effective for us in 2026 and significantly increase our tax expense. We and others are subject to a variety of complex and evolving laws, regulations, or industry standards, including with respect to environmental, health, safety, and product considerations, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. The manufacture of our products requires the use of facilities, equipment, chemicals, and materials that are subject to a broad array of laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions in which we operate. This includes increasing regulations on a class of chemicals known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Additionally, we are subject to a variety of other laws and regulations relative to the construction, maintenance, and operations of our facilities. Any changes in laws, regulations, or industry standards could cause us to incur additional direct costs, as well as increased indirect costs related to our relationships with our customers and suppliers, and otherwise harm our operations and financial condition. Any failure to comply with laws, regulations, or industry standards could adversely impact our reputation and our financial results. Additionally, we engage various third parties as sales channel partners or to represent us or otherwise act on our behalf who are also subject to a broad array of laws, regulations, and industry standards. Our engagement with these third parties may also expose us to risks associated with their respective compliance with laws and regulations. 38 Table of Contents New and evolving environmental health, safety, and product considerations, including those related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, the purchase, use and disposal of regulated and/or hazardous chemicals, and the potential resulting environmental, health or safety impacts, may result in new laws, regulations, or industry standards that may affect us, our suppliers, and our customers. Such laws, regulations, or industry standards could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers, or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. New and evolving laws and regulations relating to cybersecurity, data privacy, and AI impose requirements for information confidentiality, integrity, availability, personal and proprietary data collection, storage, use, sharing, deletion, and AI solutions that must be safe, transparent, fair, secure, human-focused, and accountable. Such laws, standards, and market expectations could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers, or partners reluctance to share information or solutions due to actual or perceived inadequate controls. These costs may adversely impact our operations and financial condition. As a result of the considerations detailed in this risk factor, we could experience the following: • suspension of production or sales of our products; • limited supplies of chemicals or materials used to make our products; • remediation costs; • increased compliance costs; • alteration of our manufacturing processes; • regulatory penalties, fines, civil or criminal sanctions, and other legal liabilities; and • reputational challenges. Compliance with, or our failure, or the failure of our third-party sales channel partners or agents, to comply with, laws, regulations, or industry standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Risks Related to Capitalization and Financial Markets We may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations, make scheduled debt payments, pay our dividend, and make adequate capital investments. Our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory and storage products sold, average selling prices, and manufacturing costs. To develop new product and process technology, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality, we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology, capital equipment, facilities, R&D, and product and process technology. We estimate capital expenditures in 2025 for property, plant, and equipment, net of proceeds from government incentives, to be around mid-30% range of revenue for the year. In the past, we have utilized external sources of financing when needed. As a result of our debt levels, expected debt amortization, prevailing interest rates, and general capital market and other economic conditions, it may be difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. We have experienced volatility in our cash flows and operating results and we expect to continue to experience such volatility in the future, which may negatively affect our credit rating. Our credit rating may also be affected by our liquidity, financial results, economic risk, or other factors, which may increase the cost of borrowings and make it difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. There can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows, access capital or credit markets, or find other sources of financing to fund our operations, make debt payments, refinance our debt, pay our quarterly dividend, and make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency. Our inability to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 39 | 2024 10-K Table of Contents Debt obligations could adversely affect our financial condition. We have incurred in the past, and expect to incur in the future, debt to finance our capital investments, business acquisitions, and to realign our capital structure. As of August 29, 2024, we had debt with a carrying value of $13.40 billion and may incur additional debt, including under our $2.50 billion Revolving Credit Facility. Our debt obligations could adversely impact us as follows: • require us to use a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on debt, which will reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund our business activities; • adversely impact our credit rating, which could increase borrowing costs and reduce our ability to raise funds on favorable terms; • limit our future ability to raise funds for capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, R&D, and other general corporate requirements; • restrict our ability to incur specified indebtedness, create or incur certain liens, and enter into sale-leaseback financing transactions; • increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; • increase our exposure to rising interest rates from variable rate indebtedness; and • result in certain of our debt instruments becoming immediately due and payable or being deemed to be in default if applicable cross default, cross-acceleration and/or similar provisions are triggered. Our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flows or obtain external financing in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to market, economic, financial, competitive, legislative, and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that additional capital will be available to us, in amounts sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs. Additionally, events and circumstances may occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy applicable draw-down conditions and utilize our Revolving Credit Facility. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows to service our debt payment obligations or satisfy our debt covenants, we may need to refinance, restructure, or amend the terms of our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Across our global operations, significant transactions and balances are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (our reporting currency), primarily the Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, euro, Indian rupee, Japanese yen, Malaysian ringgit, New Taiwan dollar, and Singapore dollar. In addition, a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in some of the foreign currencies mentioned above. Exchange rates for some of these currencies against the U.S. dollar have been volatile and may be volatile in future periods. If these currencies strengthen against the U.S. dollar, our manufacturing costs could significantly increase. Exchange rates for the U.S. dollar that adversely change against our foreign currency exposures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. We are subject to counterparty default risks. We have numerous arrangements with financial institutions that subject us to counterparty default risks, including cash deposits, investments, and derivative instruments. Additionally, we are subject to counterparty default risk from our customers for amounts receivable from them. As a result, we are subject to the risk that the counterparty will default on its performance obligations. A counterparty may not comply with its contractual commitments which could then lead to its defaulting on its obligations with little or no notice to us, which could limit our ability to mitigate our exposure. Additionally, our ability to mitigate our exposures may be constrained by the terms of our contractual arrangements or because market conditions prevent us from taking effective action. If one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterparty’s default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of such default, we could incur significant losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 40 Table of Contents The trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. Our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, we, the technology industry, and the stock market as a whole have on occasion experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to the specific operating performance of individual companies. The trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely due to various factors, including, but not limited to, actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results, changes in financial forecasts or estimates by us or financial or other market estimates and ratings by securities and other analysts, changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public, interest rate changes, regulatory changes, news regarding our products or products of our competitors, and broad market and industry fluctuations. For these reasons, investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future trading prices of our common stock, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Investors in our common stock may not realize any return on their investment in us and may lose some or all of their investment. Volatility in the trading price of our common stock could also result in the filing of securities class action litigation matters, which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources. The amount and frequency of our share repurchases may fluctuate, and we cannot guarantee that we will purchase all of the shares under our share repurchase authorization, or that it will enhance long-term shareholder value. Share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and will diminish our cash reserves. The amount, frequency, and execution of our share repurchases pursuant to our share repurchase authorization may fluctuate based on our operating results, cash flows, and priorities for the use of cash for other purposes. Our expenditures for these share repurchases were $300 million in 2024, $425 million in 2023, $2.43 billion in 2022, $1.20 billion in 2021, $176 million in 2020, and $2.66 billion in 2019. These other purposes include, but are not limited to, operational spending, capital spending, acquisitions, and repayment of debt. Other factors, including changes in tax laws, could also impact our share repurchases. Although our Board of Directors has authorized share repurchases of up to $10 billion of our outstanding common stock, the authorization does not obligate us to repurchase any common stock. We cannot guarantee that we will purchase all of the shares under our share repurchase authorization or that it will enhance long-term shareholder value. The repurchase authorization could affect the trading price of our stock and increase volatility, and any announcement of a pause in, or termination of, this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock. In addition, this program is a use of cash, which may reduce the availability of cash for other business purposes, including investments, acquisitions, dividends, or repayment of indebtedness. There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends in any particular amounts or at all. Our Board of Directors has adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which we currently pay a cash dividend on our common shares on a quarterly basis. The declaration and payment of any dividend is subject to the approval of our Board of Directors and our dividend may be discontinued or reduced at any time. There can be no assurance that we will declare cash dividends in the future in any particular amounts, or at all. Future dividends, if any, and their timing and amount, may be affected by, among other factors: our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions, debt service obligations, contractual restrictions, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. A reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock. In addition, the payment of dividends is a use of cash, which may reduce the availability of cash for other business purposes, including investments, acquisitions, or repayment of indebtedness. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. 41 | 2024 10-K Table of Contents ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY Risk Management and Strategy We have established policies and processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material risk from cybersecurity threats and have integrated these processes into our overall risk management systems and processes. We have aligned our cybersecurity program with recognized security frameworks such as NIST-CSF (National Institute of Standard and Technologies – CyberSecurity Framework). We routinely assess material risks from cybersecurity threats, including any potential unauthorized occurrence on or conducted through our information systems that may result in adverse effects on the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our information systems or any information residing therein. We conduct regular risk assessments to identify cybersecurity threats, as well as assessments in the event of a material change in our business practices that may affect information systems that are vulnerable to such cybersecurity threats. These risk assessments include identification of reasonably foreseeable internal and external risks, the likelihood and potential damage that could result from such risks, and the sufficiency of existing policies, procedures, systems, and safeguards in place to manage such risks. Following these risk assessments, we implement and maintain reasonable safeguards to minimize identified risks; reasonably address any identified gaps in existing safeguards; and regularly monitor the effectiveness of our safeguards. We devote significant resources and designate high-level personnel, including our Chief Security Officer and Chief Information Officer, to manage the risk assessment and mitigation process. We have implemented technical solutions that are designed to protect our information systems from cybersecurity threats, including firewalls, intrusion prevention and detection systems, antimalware functionality, and access controls. We regularly evaluate, monitor, and improve these solutions. As part of our overall risk management system, we monitor and test our safeguards and train our employees on these safeguards, in collaboration with human resources, information technology, legal, compliance and ethics and management. Personnel at all levels and departments are made aware of our cybersecurity policies through periodic trainings. We periodically engage assessors, consultants, auditors, or other third parties in connection with our risk assessment processes. These service providers assist us to design, implement or assess our cybersecurity policies and procedures, as well as to monitor and test our safeguards. We work with our third-party suppliers and service providers to address the use of appropriate security measures in connection with their work with us. Like any other technology company operating in today’s environment, we have experienced incidents in the past and may experience them in the future. However, we have not experienced any cybersecurity incidents that have been determined to be material. For additional information regarding risks from cybersecurity threats, and their effect on our company, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business, Operations, and Industry – Breaches of our security systems or products, systems failures, interruptions, delays in service, catastrophic events, and resulting interruptions in the availability of our systems or those of our customers, suppliers, or business partners, could expose us to losses.” Governance One of the key functions of our Board of Directors is informed oversight of our risk management process, including risks from cybersecurity threats. Our Board of Directors is responsible for monitoring and assessing strategic risk exposure, and our executive officers are responsible for the day-to-day management of the material risks we face. Our Board of Directors administers its cybersecurity risk oversight function directly as a whole, as well as through the Security Committee. 42 Table of Contents Our Chief Security Officer and our Chief Information Officer report to our Security Committee, which oversees monitoring and incident response, risk mitigation, supply chain security, physical security, product security, insider trust, and other security related items and are primarily responsible to assess and manage our material risks from cybersecurity threats. Our Chief Security Officer and Chief Information Officer have combined relevant experience of more than 45 years, including over 20 years in cybersecurity, and they oversee our cybersecurity policies and processes, including those described in “Risk Management and Strategy” above. Our Chief Security Officer monitors and stays informed about prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation efforts through regular communication and reporting from our security team, and through the use of technological tools and software and results from third party assessments. Our Chief Security Officer and Chief Information Officer provide quarterly briefings to the Security Committee regarding our company’s cybersecurity risks and activities, including any recent cybersecurity incidents and related responses, cybersecurity systems testing, activities of third parties, and the like. Our Security Committee provides regular updates to the Board of Directors on such reports. In addition, our Chief Security Officer and our Chief Information Officer provide annual briefings to the Board of Directors on cybersecurity risks and activities. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our corporate headquarters are located in Boise, Idaho. In addition to our principal facilities described below, we own or lease numerous other facilities in locations throughout the world used for design, R&D, and sales and marketing activities. The following is a summary of our principal facilities as of August 29, 2024: Location Principal Operations Taiwan R&D, wafer fabrication, component assembly and test, module assembly and test Singapore R&D, wafer fabrication, component assembly and test, module assembly and test Japan R&D, wafer fabrication United States R&D, wafer fabrication, reticle manufacturing Malaysia Component assembly and test, module assembly and test China Component assembly and test, module assembly and test India Component assembly and test, module assembly and test 43 | 2024 10-K Table of Contents We believe that our existing facilities are suitable and adequate for our present purposes. We generally utilize all of our manufacturing capacity; however, a portion of our facilities were underutilized for 2024 and 2023 due to industry conditions. See “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Overview – Industry Conditions” for information regarding our current underutilization. To support projected memory demand in the second half of the decade, we will need to add new DRAM wafer capacity. Following the enactment of the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 (“CHIPS Act”), we announced plans to invest in two leading-edge memory manufacturing fab facilities in the United States, based on CHIPS Act support through grants and investment tax credits. As part of this plan, in September 2022, we broke ground on a leading-edge memory manufacturing fab in Boise, Idaho. Construction of the fab began in October 2023, with meaningful DRAM output projected in 2027. In addition, in October 2022, we announced plans to build a second leading-edge DRAM manufacturing facility, consisting of up to four fabs to be built over the next 20-plus years, in Clay, New York. We expect construction site preparation to begin in calendar 2025, with production anticipated to ramp in the latter half of the decade. We expect these new fabs to be key to meeting our requirements for additional wafer capacity starting in the second half of the decade and beyond, in line with industry demand trends and to maintain an objective of stable bit share. We have signed a non-binding preliminary memorandum of terms with the U.S. Department of Commerce for up to $6.1 billion in direct funding under the CHIPS Act for our planned fab in Boise, Idaho and the first two planned fabs in Clay, New York. We are also eligible for federal loans up to $7.5 billion. In addition, we receive a 25% investment tax credit on qualified investments in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing under the CHIPS Act. We have also signed a non-binding term sheet with the state of New York that provides up to $5.5 billion in funding for the planned four-fab facility over the next 20-plus years through a combination of tax credits for qualified capital investments and incentives for eligible new job wages. Additionally, we began enablement of cleanroom space within our existing manufacturing fab in Hiroshima, Japan, that will support production of DRAM using EUV lithography. We also continue to advance our global back-end assembly and test network in order to support our product portfolio and extend our ability to deliver on global customer demand in the future. We have started construction to expand our existing assembly and test facility in Xi’an, China, to provide space to add more product capability, to allow us over time to serve more of the demand from our customers in China. Construction is also progressing for the assembly and test facility in Gujarat, India to address demand in the latter half of this decade. We do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment, other than goodwill. For a breakout of the carrying value of our long-lived assets by geographic area see “Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Geographic Information.” ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS For a discussion of legal proceedings, see “Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Contingencies” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. SEC regulations require disclosure of certain proceedings related to environmental matters unless we reasonably believe that the related monetary sanctions, if any, will be less than a specified threshold. We use a threshold of $1 million for this purpose. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable. PART II 44 Table of Contents ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Market Information Our common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the trading symbol “MU.” Holders of Record As of September 27, 2024, there were approximately 1,636 shareholders of record of our common stock. A substantially greater number of holders of our common stock are \"street name\" or beneficial holders, whose shares are held of record by banks, brokers, and other financial institutions. Dividends On September 25, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.115 per share, payable in cash on October 23, 2024, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on October 7, 2024. We currently expect quarterly dividends to continue in future periods and aim to grow our dividend payments over time. However, the declaration and payment of any future cash dividends are at the discretion and subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors' decisions regarding the amount and payment of dividends will depend on many factors, such as our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions, debt service obligations, contractual restrictions, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to pay a dividend in any future period. Issuer Purchase of Equity Securities Common Stock Repurchase Authorization In 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to $10 billion of our outstanding common stock through open-market purchases, block trades, privately-negotiated transactions, derivative transactions, and/or pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date, does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, and is subject to market conditions and our ongoing determination of the best use of available cash. As of August 29, 2024, $2.81 billion of the authorization remained available for the repurchase of our common stock. Shares of common stock withheld as payment of withholding taxes upon the vesting of restricted stock are also treated as common stock repurchases. Shares withheld as payment of withholding taxes upon the vesting of restricted stock units are not considered repurchases for purposes of this Item and are not required to be reported. 45 | 2024 10-K Table of Contents In the fourth quarter of 2024, shares purchased under the authorization and shares withheld as payment upon the vesting of restricted stock consisted of the following: Period Total number of shares purchased (1) Average price paid per share Total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced plans or programs Approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under publicly announced plans or programs (in millions) May 31, 2024 – June 27, 2024 — $ — — June 28, 2024 – July 25, 2024 25,931 133.55 — July 26, 2024 – August 29, 2024 3,223,518 93.07 3,223,518 3,249,449 $ 93.39 3,223,518 $2,806 (1) Includes 25,931 shares withheld as payment of withholding taxes upon the vesting of restricted stock awards.

[RESERVED] 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the year ended August 29, 2024. All period references are to our fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated. Our fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period ending on the Thursday closest to August 31. Fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022 each contained 52 weeks. All tabular dollar amounts are in millions, except per share amounts. Overview For an overview of our business, see “Part I – Item 1. Business – Overview.” Industry Conditions Throughout 2024, we experienced substantial improvements in pricing and margins. Increasing demand growth, driven in part by deployment of AI and mostly normal customer inventories, combined with industry-wide supply discipline, resulted in an industry supply and demand balance that substantially improved from 2023 conditions. We executed well on pricing and improved our financial performance significantly from the start of the year. We are exiting the year with excellent momentum and an industry-leading product portfolio. In contrast, 2023 was a year of weak memory and storage industry demand in many end markets, stemming from global macroeconomic challenges and customer actions to reduce inventory levels. These conditions, which began in the fourth quarter of 2022 and persisted into early 2024, led to significant reductions in average selling prices for both DRAM and NAND and reductions in bit shipments for DRAM. We experienced declines in revenue across all our business segments and nearly all our end markets throughout 2023. Also in 2023, China’s Cyberspace Administration (the “CAC”) conducted a cybersecurity review of our products sold in China and decided that our products presented a cybersecurity risk. The CAC determined that critical information infrastructure operators in China may not purchase Micron products. The CAC decision has impacted our business, particularly in the domestic data center and networking markets in China, and we have been working to mitigate that impact. Our goal is to retain our worldwide DRAM and NAND market share. In manufacturing, we have been fully utilized throughout most of 2024 on our high-volume manufacturing nodes where we are maximizing output against our current capacity, which we have proactively, structurally lowered. Beginning in the latter part of 2022, we reduced capital expenditures and wafer starts for both DRAM and NAND in response to challenging market conditions and increased levels of our inventories. In addition, to improve capital efficiency, we redeployed equipment from older technology nodes to support conversions to leading-edge nodes. Since the number of wafer processing steps is higher for leading-edge nodes, this approach has resulted in a meaningful structural reduction in DRAM and NAND wafer capacity. We believe this approach to node migration and consequent wafer capacity reduction was adopted across the industry. We recognized period costs from fabrication facility underutilization of $382 million in 2023 and $165 million in the first quarter of 2024 due to wafer start reductions. Subsequently, fabrication facility underutilization was reduced and principally related to legacy manufacturing capacity. Accordingly, 2024 period costs beyond the first quarter were not significant. In connection with improved 2024 market conditions, we reinstated our bonuses and phased out certain other temporary cost-saving measures that were implemented in 2023. We took significant steps in 2023 to reduce our costs and operating expenses, both on a temporary and ongoing structural basis. These measures included the 2023 Restructure Plan, as well as implementing productivity programs, suspension of our 2023 bonus, reductions in select product programs, lower discretionary spending, and cuts to 2023 executive salaries. Under the 2023 Restructure Plan, we reduced our headcount by approximately 15% by the end of calendar 2023, through a combination of voluntary attrition and personnel reductions. We incurred restructure charges of $171 million in 2023 primarily related to employee severance costs. The 2023 Restructure Plan, which was substantially completed in 2023, yielded estimated cost savings of approximately $130 million per quarter (approximately 60% in cost of goods sold, 30% in R&D, and 10% in SG&A) subsequent to 2023. 47 | 2024 10-K Table of Contents Results of Operations Consolidated Results For the year ended 2024 2023 2022 Revenue $ 25,111 100 % $ 15,540 100 % $ 30,758 100 % Cost of goods sold 19,498 78 % 16,956 109 % 16,860 55 % Gross margin 5,613 22 % (1,416) (9) % 13,898 45 % Research and development 3,430 14 % 3,114 20 % 3,116 10 % Selling, general, and administrative 1,129 4 % 920 6 % 1,066 3 % Restructure and asset impairments 1 — % 171 1 % 48 — % Other operating (income) expense, net (251) (1) % 124 1 % (34) — % Operating income (loss) 1,304 5 % (5,745) (37) % 9,702 32 % Interest income (expense), net (33) — % 80 1 % (93) — % Other non-operating income (expense), net (31) — % 7 — % (38) — % Income tax (provision) benefit (451) (2) % (177) (1) % (888) (3) % Equity in net income (loss) of equity method investees (11) — % 2 — % 4 — % Net income (loss) $ 778 3 % $ (5,833) (38) % $ 8,687 28 % Total Revenue: Total revenue for 2024 and 2023 was impacted by the factors described in the section titled “Industry Conditions” above. These conditions drove a recovery of average selling prices throughout 2024 after significant declines in average selling prices throughout 2023. Total revenue for 2024 increased 62% as compared to 2023 primarily due to increases in sales of both DRAM and NAND products. • Sales of DRAM products increased 60% primarily due to a mid-40% range increase in bit shipments and a low-teen percentage range increase in average selling prices. • Sales of NAND products increased 72% primarily due to a low-30% range increase in bit shipments and a low-30% percentage range increase in average selling prices. Total revenue for 2023 decreased 49% as compared to 2022 primarily due to decreases in sales of both DRAM and NAND products. • Sales of DRAM products decreased 51% primarily due to a high-40% range decline in average selling prices and decreases in bit shipments in the high-single-digit percent range. • Sales of NAND products decreased 46% primarily due to a low-50% range decline in average selling prices partially offset by increases in bit shipments in the high-single-digit percent range. Consolidated Gross Margin : Our consolidated gross margin has been impacted by the factors described in the section titled “Industry Conditions” above and inventory write-downs in 2023 as detailed in the table below. Our consolidated gross margin percentage improved to 22% for 2024 from negative 9% for 2023, as a result of improvements in margins for both DRAM and NAND products, primarily due to increases in average selling prices, and manufacturing cost reductions, the effects of charges to write down inventories to their NRV in 2023 and lower costs in 2024 from the sale of inventories written down in 2023 (as detailed in “Inventory NRV write-downs” below). Our consolidated gross margin percentage decreased to negative 9% for 2023 from 45% for 2022 primarily due to declines in average selling prices for both DRAM and NAND, charges to write down inventories, and $382 million of facility underutilization costs in 2023. 48 Table of Contents Inventory NRV write-downs: Our consolidated gross margin was impacted by charges in 2023 to write down inventories to their estimated NRV as a result of declines in average selling prices for both DRAM and NAND. As charges to write down inventories are recorded in advance of when inventories are sold, costs of goods sold in subsequent periods were lower than they otherwise would be. The impact of inventory NRV write-downs for each period reflects (1) inventory write-downs in that period, offset by (2) lower costs in that period on the sale of inventory written down in prior periods. The impacts of inventory NRV write-downs are summarized below: For the year ended 2024 2023 2022 Provision to write down inventory to NRV $ — $ (1,831) $ — Lower costs from sale of inventory written down in prior periods 987 844 — $ 987 $ (987) $ — Revenue by Business Unit For the year ended 2024 2023 2022 CNBU $ 9,513 38 % $ 5,710 37 % $ 13,693 45 % MBU 6,354 25 % 3,630 23 % 7,260 24 % EBU 4,614 18 % 3,637 23 % 5,235 17 % SBU 4,592 18 % 2,553 16 % 4,553 15 % All Other 38 — % 10 — % 17 — % $ 25,111 $ 15,540 $ 30,758 Percentages of total revenue may not total 100% due to rounding. Changes in revenue for each business unit for 2024 as compared to 2023 were as follows: • CNBU revenue increased 67% driven by increases in bit shipments and DRAM average selling prices. • MBU revenue increased 75% primarily due to increases in average selling prices and bit shipments for both mobile DRAM and NAND. • EBU revenue increased 27% primarily due to increases in bit shipments, partially offset by declines in average selling prices. • SBU revenue increased 80% primarily due to increases in average selling prices and bit shipments. Changes in revenue for each business unit for 2023 as compared to 2022 were as follows: • CNBU revenue decreased 58% primarily due to declines in average selling prices for DRAM and decreases in bit shipments. • MBU revenue decreased 50% primarily due to declines in average selling prices for both DRAM and NAND and decreases in NAND bit shipments. • EBU revenue decreased 31% primarily due to declines in average selling prices for both DRAM and NAND and decreases in bit shipments. • SBU revenue decreased 44% primarily due to declines in average selling prices for NAND partially offset by increases in bit shipments. 49 | 2024 10-K Table of Contents Operating Income (Loss) by Business Unit For the year ended 2024 2023 2022 CNBU $ 980 10 % $ (585) (10) % $ 5,844 43 % MBU 114 2 % (1,750) (48) % 2,160 30 % EBU 199 4 % 382 11 % 1,752 33 % SBU (362) (8) % (1,887) (74) % 513 11 % All Other 17 45 % 8 80 % 12 71 % $ 948 $ (3,832) $ 10,281 Percentages reflect operating income (loss) as a percentage of revenue for each business unit. Changes in operating income or loss for each business unit for 2024 as compared to 2023 were as follows: • CNBU operating income (loss) improved primarily due to higher bit shipments, increases in average selling prices, and cost reductions, partially offset by higher R&D expenses. • MBU operating income (loss) improved primarily due to increases in average selling prices, higher bit shipments, and cost reductions. • EBU operating income decreased primarily due to declines in average selling prices, partially offset by higher bit shipments and cost reductions. • SBU operating income (loss) improved primarily due to increases in average selling prices, higher bit shipments, and cost reductions, partially offset by higher R&D expenses. Changes in operating income or loss for each business unit for 2023 as compared to 2022 were as follows: • CNBU operating income (loss) deteriorated primarily due to declines in average selling prices and lower bit shipments. • MBU operating income (loss) deteriorated primarily due to declines in average selling prices and lower NAND bit shipments. • EBU operating income decreased primarily due to declines in average selling prices and lower bit shipments. • SBU operating income (loss) deteriorated primarily due to declines in average selling prices. Operating Expenses and Other Research and Development: R&D expenses vary primarily with the number of development and pre-qualification wafers processed, the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development, and personnel costs. Because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products, we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing. Development of a product is deemed complete when it is qualified through internal reviews and tests for performance and reliability. R&D expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification. R&D expenses for 2024 increased 10% as compared to 2023 primarily due to an increase in employee compensation and higher volumes of development and prequalification wafers, partially offset by an increase in government incentives. R&D expenses for 2023 were relatively unchanged as compared to 2022 as decreases in employee compensation were offset by higher depreciation expense. Selling, General, and Administrative: SG&A expenses for 2024 increased 23% as compared to 2023 primarily due to an increase in employee compensation. SG&A expenses for 2023 were 14% lower as compared to 2022 primarily due to decreases in employee compensation, legal fees, advertising, and professional services. 50 Table of Contents Interest Income (Expense), Net : Interest income (expense) deteriorated for 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to increases in interest expense as a result of higher interest rates on our debt, partially offset by increases in interest income due to higher interest rates on our cash and investments. Interest income (expense) improved for 2023 as compared to 2022 primarily as a result of increases in interest income due to higher interest rates on our cash and investments, partially offset by increases in interest expense due to higher debt balances and interest rates on our debt. Income Taxes: Our income tax (provision) benefit consisted of the following: For the year ended 2024 2023 2022 Income (loss) before taxes $ 1,240 $ (5,658) $ 9,571 Income tax (provision) benefit (451) (177) (888) Effective tax rate 36.4 % (3.1) % 9.3 % The change in our effective tax rate for 2024 as compared to 2023 was primarily due to changes in profitability. The change in our effective tax rate for 2023 as compared to 2022 was primarily due to a pre-tax loss in 2023. Despite a consolidated pre-tax loss on a worldwide basis in 2023, we had taxes payable in certain geographies due to minimum taxable income reportable in those geographies. We operate in a number of jurisdictions outside the United States, including Singapore, where we have tax incentive arrangements. These incentives expire, in whole or in part, at various dates through 2034 and are conditional, in part, upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds. As a result of the low level of profitability and jurisdictional mix of income, the benefit from tax incentive arrangements was not material for 2024 or 2023. The effect of tax incentive arrangements reduced our tax provision by $1.12 billion (benefiting our diluted earnings per share by $1.00) for 2022. Further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project, including Pillar Two Model Rules (“Pillar Two”), undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”). Nearly all European Union member states have enacted the Pillar Two legislation, which will be effective for us in 2025. While we do not expect these enacted laws to materially impact our effective tax rate for 2025, additional countries where we operate, including Singapore, have announced plans to adopt Pillar Two legislation. Enactment of this legislation would become effective for us in 2026 and significantly increase our tax expense. Various tax reforms are being considered in multiple jurisdictions that, if enacted, contain provisions that could materially impact our tax expense. We continue to monitor the potential impact of these various tax reform proposals to our overall global effective tax rate and financial statements.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”: • Equity Compensation Plans • Restructure and Asset Impairments • Other Operating (Income) Expense, Net • Income Taxes 51 | 2024 10-K Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and financing obtained from capital markets and financial institutions. Cash generated from operations is highly dependent on selling prices for our products, which can vary significantly from period to period. Cash and marketable investments totaled $9.15 billion as of August 29, 2024, and $10.44 billion as of August 31, 2023. Our cash and investments consist primarily of bank deposits, money market funds, and liquid investment-grade, fixed-income securities, which are diversified among industries and individual issuers. To mitigate credit risk, we invest through high-credit-quality financial institutions and by policy generally limit the concentration of credit exposure by restricting the amount of investments with any single obligor. As of August 29, 2024, $3.34 billion of our cash and marketable investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries. We continuously evaluate alternatives for efficiently funding our capital expenditures and ongoing operations. We expect to engage in a variety of financing transactions, from time to time, for such purposes as well as to refinance our existing indebtedness, including the issuance of securities. As of August 29, 2024, $2.50 billion was available to draw under our Revolving Credit Facility. Funding of certain significant capital projects is also dependent on the receipt of government incentives, which are subject to conditions and may not be obtained. To develop new product and process technology, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality, we must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies, facilities and equipment, and R&D. We estimate capital expenditures in 2025 for property, plant, and equipment, net of proceeds from government incentives, to be around mid-30% range of revenue for the year. Actual amounts for 2025 will vary depending on market conditions and may vary from quarter to quarter due to the timing of expenditures and proceeds from government incentives. As of August 29, 2024, we had purchase obligations of approximately $1.17 billion for the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment, of which approximately $1.10 billion is expected to be paid within one year. For a description of other contractual obligations, such as leases, debt, and commitments, see “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Leases,” “ – Debt,” and “ – Commitments.” To support projected memory demand in the second half of the decade, we will need to add new DRAM wafer capacity. Following the enactment of the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 (“CHIPS Act”), we announced plans to invest in two leading-edge memory manufacturing fab facilities in the United States, based on CHIPS Act support through grants and investment tax credits. As part of this plan, in September 2022, we broke ground on a leading-edge memory manufacturing fab in Boise, Idaho. Construction of the fab began in October 2023, with meaningful DRAM output projected in 2027. In addition, in October 2022, we announced plans to build a second leading-edge DRAM manufacturing facility, consisting of up to four fabs to be built over the next 20-plus years, in Clay, New York. We expect construction site preparation to begin in calendar 2025, with production anticipated to ramp in the latter half of the decade. We expect these new fabs to be key to meeting our requirements for additional wafer capacity starting in the second half of the decade and beyond, in line with industry demand trends and to maintain an objective of stable bit share. We have signed a non-binding preliminary memorandum of terms with the U.S. Department of Commerce for up to $6.1 billion in direct funding under the CHIPS Act for our planned fab in Boise, Idaho and the first two planned fabs in Clay, New York. We are also eligible for federal loans up to $7.5 billion. In addition, we receive a 25% investment tax credit on qualified investments in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing under the CHIPS Act. We have also signed a non-binding term sheet with the state of New York that provides up to $5.5 billion in funding for the planned four-fab facility over the next 20-plus years through a combination of tax credits for qualified capital investments and incentives for eligible new job wages. Additionally, we began enablement of cleanroom space within our existing manufacturing fab in Hiroshima, Japan, that will support production of DRAM using EUV lithography. We also continue to advance our global back-end assembly and test network in order to support our product portfolio and extend our ability to deliver on global customer demand in the future. We have started construction to expand our existing assembly and test facility in Xi’an, China, to provide space to add more product capability, to allow us over time to serve more of the demand from our customers in China. Construction is also progressing for the assembly and test facility in Gujarat, India to address demand in the latter half of this decade. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Government Incentives.” 52 Table of Contents Our Board of Directors has authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to $10 billion of our outstanding common stock through open-market purchases, block trades, privately-negotiated transactions, derivative transactions, and/or pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date, does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, and is subject to market conditions and our ongoing determination of the best use of available cash. Through August 29, 2024, we had repurchased an aggregate of $7.19 billion of the authorized amount. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Equity.” On September 25, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.115 per share, payable in cash on October 23, 2024, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on October 7, 2024. The declaration and payment of any future cash dividends are at the discretion and subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors' decisions regarding the amount and payment of dividends will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions, debt service obligations, contractual restrictions, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. We expect that our cash and investments, cash flows from operations, expected funding from government incentives, and available financing will be sufficient to meet our requirements at least through the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Cash Flows For the year ended 2024 2023 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 8,507 $ 1,559 $ 15,181 Net cash provided by (used for) investing activities (8,309) (6,191) (11,585) Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities (1,842) 4,983 (2,980) Effect of changes in currency exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 40 (34) (106) Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ (1,604) $ 317 $ 510 Operating Activities: Cash provided by operating activities reflects net income (loss) adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation expense, amortization of intangible assets, inventory write-downs, asset impairments, and stock-based compensation, and the effects of changes in operating assets and liabilities . The increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2024 as compared to 2023 was primarily due to net income in 2024 adjusted for non-cash items, the effect of an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and an increase in other current liabilities largely due to customer prepayments to secur e p roduct supply, partially offset by an increase in receivables. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities for 2023 as compared to 2022 was primarily due to a net loss in 2023 adjusted for non-cash items and the effect of an increase in inventories and a decline in accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offset by a decrease in receivables. Investing Activities: For 2024, net cash used for investing activi ties consisted primarily of $8.39 billion of expenditures for property, plant, and equipment; and $205 million of net outflows from purchases, maturities, and sales of available-for-sale securities; partially offset by contributions of $315 million received from government incentives to offset capital expenditures. For 2023, net cash used for investing activities consisted primarily of $7.68 billion of expenditures for property, plant, and equipment; partially offset by contributions of $710 million received from government incentives to offset capital expenditures; and $868 million of net inflows from maturities, sales, and purchases of available-for-sale securities. 53 | 2024 10-K Table of Contents For 2022, net cash used for investing activities consisted primarily of $12.07 billion of expenditures for property, plant, and equipment; partially offset by contributions of $115 million received from government incentives to offset capital expenditures; $888 million of net inflows from the sale of the Lehi, Utah fab; and $155 million of net outflows from purchases, maturities, and sales of available-for-sale securities. Financing Activities: For 2024, net cash used for financing activi ties consisted primarily of $1.90 billion of repayments of debt, which included the prepayment of the 2024 Term Loan A and the 2025 Term Loan A borrowings; $513 million for paym ents of dividends to shareholders; $300 million for the acquisition of 3.2 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase authorization; an d $149 million of payments on equipment purchase contracts, partially offset by approximately $1.00 billion of proceeds from the issuance of the 2031 Notes. For 2023, net cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of $3.20 billion of proceeds from our 2025, 2026, and 2027 Term Loan A borrowings; $1.27 billion from the issuance of the 2029 B Notes; $896 million from the issuance of the 2033 B Notes; $749 million from the issuance of the 2033 A Notes; and $599 million from the issuance of the 2028 Notes. Cash used for financing activities included $761 million for repayments of debt; $504 million for payments of dividends to shareholders; $425 million for the acquisition of 8.6 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase authorization; and $138 million of payments on equipment purchase contracts. For 2022, net cash used for financing activities included $2.43 billion for the acquisition of 35.4 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase authorization; $2.03 billion of repayments of debt primarily to redeem the 2023 Notes and 2024 Notes; $461 million of cash payments of dividends to shareholders; and $141 million of payments on equipment purchase contracts. Cash used for financing activities was partially offset by aggregate proceeds of $2.00 billion from the issuance of the unsecured 2032 Green Bonds, 2041 Notes, and 2051 Notes. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Debt.” Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, forecasted events, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions and involve a significant level of uncertainty. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. Our management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management’s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments. Contingencies : We are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. Significant judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of a loss, if any, from such contingencies. An accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired, and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In accounting for the resolution of contingencies, significant judgment may be necessary to estimate amounts pertaining to periods prior to the resolution that are charged to operations in the period of resolution and amounts related to future periods. 54 Table of Contents Goodwill : We test goodwill for impairment in our fourth quarter each year, or more frequently if indicators of an impairment exist, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit with goodwill is less than its carrying value. For reporting units for which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value, goodwill is considered not impaired, and we are not required to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. Qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the fair value of the reporting unit. For reporting units for which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is below the carrying value, goodwill is tested for impairment by determining the fair value of each reporting unit and comparing it to the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we recognize an impairment loss up to the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value. We recognized a charge of $101 million in 2023 to impair all of the goodwill assigned to our SBU reporting unit based on our quantitative assessment for impairment. We performed a qualitative assessment for the current year and have not identified any impairment indicators for our reporting units. Determining when to test for impairment, the reporting units, the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, and the fair value of the reporting unit requires significant judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates, forecasted manufacturing costs, and other expenses and are developed as part of our long-range planning process. The same estimates are used in business planning, forecasting, and capital budgeting as part of our long-term manufacturing capacity analysis. These estimates and assumptions are used to calculate projected future cash flows for the reporting unit, which are discounted using a risk-adjusted rate to estimate a fair value. The discount rate requires determination of appropriate market comparables. We base fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. We assess the reasonableness of our methodology, forecasts, and assumptions by comparing the aggregate calculated fair value for our reporting units to our market capitalization. Income taxes : We are required to estimate our provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world. These estimates involve significant judgment and interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex. Resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of the applicable year. We are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires the assessment of our performance and other relevant factors. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income. Our income tax provision or benefit is dependent, in part, on our ability to forecast future taxable income in Japan, the United States, Malaysia, Taiwan, and other jurisdictions. Such forecasts are inherently difficult and involve significant judgments including, among others, projecting future average selling prices and sales volumes, manufacturing and overhead costs, levels of capital spending, and other factors that significantly impact our analyses of the amount of net deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized. Inventories : Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being determined on a first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) basis. Cost includes depreciation, labor, material, and overhead costs, including product and process technology costs. Determining net realizable value of finished goods and work in process inventories involves significant judgments, including projecting future average selling prices, future sales volumes, and future cost per part. To project average selling prices and sales volumes, we review recent sales volumes, existing customer orders, current contract prices, industry analyses of supply and demand, and general economic trends. To project cost per part, we review trends with historical results and consider known changes in our cost structure as applicable. Actual selling prices may vary significantly from projected prices due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory and storage markets. When these analyses reflect estimated net realizable values below our manufacturing costs, we record a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when inventories are actually sold. As a result, the timing of when product costs are charged to costs of goods sold can vary significantly. Differences in future average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of finished goods and work in process inventories and accordingly the amount of write-down recorded. For example, a 5% decrease in future average selling prices would have changed the estimated net realizable value of our finished goods and work in process inventories by approximately $700 million as of August 29, 2024. 55 | 2024 10-K Table of Contents U.S. GAAP provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to net realizable values. The amount of any inventory write-down can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories. We review the major characteristics of product type and markets in determining the unit of account for which we perform the lower of cost or net realizable value analysis and categorize all inventories (including DRAM, NAND, and other memory) as a single group. Property, plant, and equipment : We periodically assess the estimated useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment based on technology node transitions, capital spending, and equipment re-use rates. We also review the carrying value of property, plant, and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and/or disposition. In cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets. The estimate of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require significant judgment by us, including, but not limited to, future use of the assets for our operations versus sale or disposal of the assets, future selling prices for our products, and future production and sales volumes. Revenue recognition : Revenue is primarily recognized at a point in time when control of the promised goods is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods. Contracts with our customers are generally short-term in duration at fixed, negotiated prices with payment generally due shortly after delivery. We estimate a liability for returns using the expected value method based on historical returns. In addition, we generally offer price protection to our distributors, which is a form of variable consideration that decreases the transaction price. We use the expected value method, based on historical price adjustments and current pricing trends, to estimate the amount of revenue recognized from sales to distributors. Differences between the estimated and actual amounts are recognized as adjustments to revenue. Recently Issued Accounting Standards See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Recently Issued Accounting Standards.” ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our indebtedness and our investment portfolio. As of August 29, 2024 and August 31, 2023, we had fixed-rate debt with an aggregate carrying value of $8.52 billion and $7.52 billion, respectively, and as a result, the fair value of our debt fluctuates with changes in market interest rates. We estimate that, as of August 29, 2024 and August 31, 2023, a hypothetical 1% decrease in market interest rates would increase the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by approximately $520 million and $475 million, respectively. Interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio is managed by primarily investing in shorter term securities. We estimate that, as of August 29, 2024 and August 31, 2023, a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our portfolio by approximately $20 million. Such impact would only be realized if investments were sold prior to maturity. As of August 29, 2024 and August 31, 2023, we had floating-rate debt, including fixed-rate debt that is swapped to floating-rate debt, with an aggregate principal amount of $2.89 billion and $4.63 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 1% increase in the interest rates of this floating-rate debt would result in an increase in annual interest expense of $29 million and $46 million as of August 29, 2024 and August 31, 2023, respectively. 56 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The information in this section should be read in conjunction with the information related to changes in the currency exchange rates in “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.” The functional currency for all of our operations is the U.S. dollar. The substantial majority of our sales are transacted in the U.S. dollar; however, significant amounts of our operating expenses and capital expenditures, and certain assets and liabilities, are incurred in or exposed to other currencies, primarily the Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, euro, Indian rupee, Japanese yen, Malaysian ringgit, New Taiwan dollar, and Singapore dollar. We have established currency risk management programs for our monetary assets and liabilities, investments in debt instruments, and forecasted future cash flows denominated in foreign currencies to hedge against fluctuations in the fair value and volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates. We generally utilize currency forward contracts in these hedging programs, which reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Based on monetary assets and liabilities and investments in debt instruments denominated in foreign currencies, we estimate that a hypothetical 10% adverse change in exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar would result in losses of approximately $480 million as of August 29, 2024 and $129 million as of August 31, 2023. We hedge our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates by utilizing a rolling hedge strategy for our primary currency exposures with currency forward contracts that generally mature within three months. The effectiveness of our hedges is dependent, among other factors, upon our ability to accurately measure exposures on a timely basis. We may also hedge currency risk arising from foreign currency-denominated investments in debt instruments with currency forward contracts that generally mature within one year. To hedge the exposure of changes in cash flows from changes in currency exchange rates for certain capital expenditures and manufacturing costs, we may utilize currency forward contracts that generally mature within two years.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (All tabular amounts in millions, except per share amounts) Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation We are an industry leader in innovative memory and storage solutions transforming how the world uses information to enrich life for all . With a relentless focus on our customers, technology leadership, and manufacturing and operational excellence, Micron delivers a rich portfolio of high-performance DRAM, NAND, and NOR memory and storage products through our Micron® and Crucial® brands. Every day, the innovations that our people create fuel the data economy, enabling advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and compute-intensive applications that unleash opportunities — from the data center to the intelligent edge and across the client and mobile user experience. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Micron Technology, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to current period presentation. Our fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period ending on the Thursday closest to August 31. Fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022 each contained 52 weeks. All period references are to our fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated. Derivative and Hedging Instruments We use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates from (1) our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, (2) non-U.S.-dollar-denominated investments in debt instruments, and (3) forecasted cash flows for certain capital expenditures and manufacturing costs. We also use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to changes in commodity prices for manufacturing supplies and to minimize certain exposures to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt that result from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates. Derivative instruments are measured at their fair values and recognized as either assets or liabilities. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivative instruments is based on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments that are not designated for hedge accounting, gains or losses from changes in fair values are recognized in other non-operating income (expense) and cash flows are classified as investing activities in the statement of cash flows. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains or losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same line items and in the same periods in which the underlying transactions affect earnings. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair values of the derivative instruments and the offsetting changes in the fair values of the underlying hedged items are both recognized in earnings. For foreign currency and commodity derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges or fair value hedges, time value is excluded from the assessment of effectiveness and the gains and losses attributable to time value are recognized in earnings through an amortization approach. Cash flows from derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges or fair value hedges are classified in the same category as the items being hedged. We enter into master netting arrangements with our counterparties to mitigate credit risk in derivative hedge transactions. These master netting arrangements allow us and our counterparties to net settle amounts owed to each other. Derivative assets and liabilities that can be net settled with each counterparty have been presented in our consolidated balance sheet on a net basis. 64 Table of Contents Financial Instruments Cash equivalents include highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities at the time of purchase of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash. Other investments with remaining maturities of less than one year are included in short-term investments. Investments with remaining maturities greater than one year are included in long-term marketable investments. The carrying value of investment securities sold is determined using the specific identification method. Functional Currency The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for us and all of our consolidated subsidiaries. Goodwill We perform an annual impairment assessment for goodwill in our fourth quarter each year. Government Incentives We receive incentives from governmental entities related to capital expenditures, expenses, and other activities. Our government incentives may require that we meet or maintain specified spending levels and other operational metrics and may be subject to reimbursement if such conditions are not met or maintained. Government incentives are recorded in the financial statements in accordance with their purpose: as a reduction of asset costs or a reduction of expenses. Incentives related to the acquisition or construction of fixed assets are recognized as a reduction in the carrying amounts of the related assets and as a reduction to depreciation expense over the useful lives of the assets. Incentives related to specific operating activities are offset against the related expense in the period the expense is incurred. Government incentives received prior to being earned are recognized in current or noncurrent deferred income, whereas government incentives earned prior to being received are recognized in current or noncurrent receivables. Cash received from government incentives related to operating expenses is included as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows, whereas cash received from incentives related to the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment is included as an investing activity. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being determined on a FIFO basis. Cost includes depreciation, labor, material, and overhead costs, including product and process technology costs. Determining net realizable value of finished goods and work in process inventories requires projecting future average selling prices, sales volumes, and costs per part. When net realizable value is below cost, we record a charge to cost of goods sold to write down inventories to their estimated net realizable value in advance of when inventories are actually sold. We review the major characteristics of product type and markets in determining the unit of account for which we perform the lower of cost or net realizable value analysis and categorize all inventories (including DRAM, NAND, and other memory) as a single group. Leases We determine if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at the inception of the arrangement and evaluate whether the lease is an operating lease or a finance lease at the commencement date. We recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for operating and finance leases with terms greater than 12 months. Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an asset for the lease term, while lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments. We do not separate lease and non-lease components for real-estate and gas plant leases. Sublease income is included within lease expense. 65 | 2024 10-K Table of Contents Product and Process Technology Costs incurred to (1) acquire product and process technology, (2) patent technology, and (3) keep patents in force, are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging up to 12.5 years. We capitalize a portion of costs incurred to patent technology based on historical data of patents issued as a percent of patents we file. Product and process technology costs are amortized over the shorter of (1) the estimated useful life of the technology, (2) the patent term, or (3) the term of the technology agreement. Fully-amortized assets are removed from product and process technology and accumulated amortization. Product Warranty We generally provide a limited warranty that our products are in compliance with applicable specifications existing at the time of delivery. Under our standard terms and conditions of sale, liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of, or a credit with respect to, amounts paid for such items. Under certain circumstances, we provide more extensive limited warranty coverage than that provided under our standard terms and conditions. Our warranty obligations are not material. Property, Plant, and Equipment Property, plant, and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of generally 10 to 30 years for buildings, 7 years for production equipment, up to 7 years for other equipment, and 3 to 5 years for software. Assets held for sale are carried at the lower of estimated fair value or carrying value and are included in current assets. When property, plant, or equipment is retired or otherwise disposed, the net book value is removed and we recognize any gain or loss in results of operations. We capitalize interest on borrowings during the period of time we carry out the activities necessary to bring assets to the condition of their intended use and location. We utilize a weighted average capitalization rate that is based on our consolidated debt portfolio. Capitalized interest becomes part of the cost of assets. Research and Development Costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are charged to R&D expense as incurred. Development of a product is deemed complete when it is qualified through reviews and tests for performance and reliability. Subsequent to product qualification, product costs are included in cost of goods sold. Revenue Recognition Revenue is primarily recognized at a point in time when control of the promised goods is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods. Contracts with our customers are generally short-term in duration at fixed, negotiated prices with payment generally due shortly after delivery. We estimate a liability for returns using the expected value method based on historical returns. In addition, we generally offer price protection to our distributors, which is a form of variable consideration that decreases the transaction price. We use the expected value method, based on historical price adjustments and current pricing trends, to estimate the amount of revenue recognized from sales to distributors. Differences between the estimated and actual amounts are recognized as adjustments to revenue. Stock-based Compensation Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and recognized as expense under the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period. We account for forfeitures as they occur. We issue new shares upon the exercise of stock options, conversion of share units, or issuance of shares under our ESPP. Treasury Stock Treasury stock is carried at cost. When we retire our treasury stock, any excess of the repurchase price paid over par value is allocated between additional capital and retained earnings. 66 Table of Contents Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, forecasted events, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and judgments may differ under different assumptions or conditions. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. Actual results could differ from estimates. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07 (ASC Topic 280), Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures . This ASU expands on existing reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. This ASU is effective for our annual reporting for 2025 on a retrospective basis. This standard will impact our disclosures and will not impact our financial statements. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 (ASC Topic 740), Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures . This ASU requires disaggregated income tax disclosures on the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. This ASU will be effective for our annual reporting for 2026 on a prospective basis, with retrospective application permitted. This standard will impact our disclosures and will not impact our financial statements. Variable Interest Entities A number of special purpose entities (the \"Lease SPEs\") were created by a third-party to facilitate equipment lease financing transactions between us and financial institutions that fund the lease financing transactions (\"Financing Entities\"). Neither we nor the Financing Entities have an equity interest in the Lease SPEs. The Lease SPEs are variable interest entities because their equity is not sufficient to permit them to finance their activities without additional support from the Financing Entities and because the third-party equity holder lacks characteristics of a controlling financial interest. By design, the arrangements with the Lease SPEs are merely financing vehicles and we do not bear any significant risks from variable interests with the Lease SPEs. We have determined that we do not have the power to direct the activities of the Lease SPEs that most significantly impact their economic performance and we do not consolidate the Lease SPEs. As of August 29, 2024, we had approximately $ 680 million of financial lease liabilities and right-of-use assets under these arrangements. 67 | 2024 10-K Table of Contents Cash and Investments All of our short-term investments and long-term marketable investments were classified as available-for-sale as of the dates noted below. Cash and equivalents and the fair values of our available-for-sale investments, which approximated amortized costs, were as follows: As of August 29, 2024 As of August 31, 2023 Cash and Equivalents Short-term Investments Long-term Marketable Investments (1) Total Fair Value Cash and Equivalents Short-term Investments Long-term Marketable Investments (1) Total Fair Value Cash $ 6,654 $ — $ — $ 6,654 $ 5,771 $ — $ — $ 5,771 Level 1 (2) Money market funds 20 — — 20 1,629 — — 1,629 Level 2 (3) Certificates of deposit 316 6 — 322 1,172 25 — 1,197 Corporate bonds — 771 571 1,342 — 737 437 1,174 Asset-backed securities — 46 433 479 — 15 387 402 Commercial paper 16 160 — 176 — 109 — 109 Government securities 35 82 42 159 5 131 20 156 7,041 $ 1,065 $ 1,046 $ 9,152 8,577 $ 1,017 $ 844 $ 10,438 Restricted cash (4) 11 79 Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 7,052 $ 8,656 (1) The maturities of long-term marketable investments primarily range from one to five years , except for asset-backed securities which are not due at a single maturity date. (2) The fair value of Level 1 securities is measured based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. (3) The fair value of Level 2 securities is measured using information obtained from pricing services, which obtain quoted market prices for similar instruments, non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data, or various other methodologies, to determine the appropriate value at the measurement date. We perform supplemental analysis to validate information obtained from these pricing services. No adjustments were made to the fair values indicated by such pricing information as of August 29, 2024 or August 31, 2023. (4) Restricted cash is included in other current assets and other noncurrent assets and primarily relates to certain government incentives received prior to being earned and for which restrictions lapse upon achieving certain performance conditions or which will be returned if performance conditions are not met. Gross realized gains and losses from sales of available-for-sale securities were not significant for any period presented. Non-marketable Equity Investments In addition to the amounts included in the table above, we had $ 190 million and $ 218 million of non-marketable equity investments without a readily determinable fair value that were included in other noncurrent assets as of August 29, 2024 and August 31, 2023, respectively. For non-marketable investments, we recognized in other non-operating income (expense) a net loss of $ 32 million for 2024 and $ 7 million for 2023 and a net gain of $ 36 million for 2022. Our non-marketable equity investments are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis and classified as Level 3. 68 Table of Contents Receivables As of August 29, 2024 August 31, 2023 Trade receivables $ 5,419 $ 2,048 Government incentives 834 105 Income and other taxes 268 194 Other 94 96 $ 6,615 $ 2,443 Inventories As of August 29, 2024 August 31, 2023 Finished goods $ 1,308 $ 1,616 Work in process 6,774 6,111 Raw materials and supplies 793 660 $ 8,875 $ 8,387 In 2023, we recorded charges of $ 1.83 billion to cost of goods sold to write down the carrying value of work in process and finished goods inventories to their estimated net realizable value.

Interest capitalized as part of the cost of property, plant, and equipment was $ 225 million, $ 208 million, and $ 77 million for 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. 69 | 2024 10-K Table of Contents Leases We have finance and operating leases through which we obtain the right to use facilities, land, and equipment that support our business operations. Our finance leas es consist primarily of (i) gas and other supply agreements that are deemed to contain embedded leases and (ii) equipment leases. Ou r operating leases consist primarily of offices, laboratories, other facilities, and land. Certain of our operating leases include one or more options to extend the lease term for periods from one year to 10 years for real estate and one year to 99 years for land. Certain supply or service agreements require us to exercise significant judgment to determine whether the agreement contains a lease. Our assessment includes determining whether we or the supplier control the assets used to fulfill the agreements by identifying whether we or the supplier have the right to change the type, quantity, timing, or location of the output of the assets. Our gas supply arrangements generally are deemed to contain a lease because we have the right to substantially all of the output of the assets used to produce the supply and we have the right to change the quantity and timing of the output of those assets. In determining the lease term, we assess whether we are reasonably certain to exercise any options to renew or terminate a lease or to purchase the right-of-use asset. Measuring the present value of the initial lease liability requires judgment to determine the discount rate, which we base on interest rates for borrowings with similar terms and collateral issued by entities with credit ratings similar to ours. The components of lease cost are presented below: For the year ended 2024 2023 2022 Finance lease cost Amortization of right-of-use asset $ 176 $ 105 $ 99 Interest on lease liability 70 24 24 Operating lease cost (1) 140 137 125 $ 386 $ 266 $ 248 (1) Operating lease cost includes short-term and variable lease expenses, which were not material for the periods presented.

The resulting variable interest paid is at a rate equal to SOFR plus approximately 3.33 %. The fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges, and as a result, the carrying values of our 2027 Notes reflect adjustments in fair value. As of August 29, 2024, all of our debt, other than finance lease obligations, were unsecured obligations that rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future unsecured indebtedness and were effectively subordinated to all future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. All our unsecured debt were obligations of our parent company, Micron, and were structurally subordinated to all liabilities of its subsidiaries, including trade payables. The terms of our indebtedness generally contain cross payment default and cross acceleration provisions. Micron’s guarantees of certain liabilities of its subsidiaries are unsecured obligations ranking equally in right of payment with all of Micron’s other existing and future unsecured indebtedness. 72 Table of Contents Debt Activity The table below presents the effects of debt financing and prepayment activities in 2024: Transaction Date Increase (Decrease) in Principal Increase (Decrease) in Carrying Value Increase (Decrease) in Cash Issuances 2031 Notes January 12, 2024 $ 1,000 $ 993 $ 993 Prepayments 2024 Term Loan A January 12, 2024 ( 588 ) ( 587 ) ( 588 ) 2025 Term Loan A January 12, 2024 ( 402 ) ( 401 ) ( 402 ) 2025 Term Loan A May 29, 2024 ( 650 ) ( 649 ) ( 650 ) $ ( 640 ) $ ( 644 ) $ ( 647 ) In 2023, we issued $ 6.70 billion of senior unsecured notes and term loan agreements and received cash of $ 6.69 billion. We prepaid $ 600 million of principal amount of the 2024 Term Loan A. In 2022, we issued $ 2.00 billion of senior unsecured notes and received cash of $ 1.99 billion. We prepaid $ 1.85 billion of principal amount of notes for $ 1.93 billion in cash. We recognized losses of $ 83 million in connection with these prepayments. Senior Unsecured Notes We may redeem our 2026 Notes, 2027 Notes, 2028 Notes, 2029 A Notes, 2029 B Notes, 2030 Notes, 2031 Notes, 2032 Green Bonds, 2033 A Notes, 2033 B Notes, 2041 Notes, and 2051 Notes (the “Senior Unsecured Notes”), in whole or in part, at our option prior to their respective maturity dates at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100 % of the principal amount of the Senior Unsecured Notes to be redeemed and (ii) the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest, in each case plus accrued interest. We may also redeem any series of our Senior Unsecured Notes, in whole or in part, at a price equal to par between one and six months prior to maturity in accordance with the respective terms of such series. Each series of Senior Unsecured Notes contains covenants that, among other things, limit, in certain circumstances, our ability and/or the ability of our restricted subsidiaries (which are generally domestic subsidiaries in which we own at least 80 % of the voting stock and which own principal property, as defined in the indenture governing such series) to (1) create or incur certain liens; (2) enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions; and (3) consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer, or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets, to another entity. These covenants are subject to a number of limitations and exceptions. Additionally, if a change of control triggering event, as defined in the indentures governing our Senior Unsecured Notes, occurs with respect to a series of Senior Unsecured Notes, we will be required to offer to purchase such Senior Unsecured Notes at 101 % of the outstanding aggregate principal amount plus accrued interest up to the purchase date. Multi-Tranche Term Loan Agreement The 2026 Term Loan A and 2027 Term Loan A (the “Multi-Tranche Term Loan Agreement”) require equal quarterly installment payments in an amount equal to 1.25 % of the original principal amount. Borrowings under the Multi-Tranche Term Loan Agreement will generally bear interest at adjusted term SOFR plus an applicable interest rate margin ranging from 1.00 % to 2.00 %, varying by tranche and depending on our corporate credit ratings. Adjusted term SOFR for the Multi-Tranche Term Loan Agreement is the SOFR benchmark plus 0.10 %. The Multi-Tranche Term Loan Agreement requires us to maintain, on a consolidated basis, a leverage ratio of total indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the Multi-Tranche Term Loan Agreement and calculated as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, not to exceed 3.25 to 1.00, subject to a temporary four quarter increase in such ratio to 3.75 to 1.00 following certain material acquisitions. 73 | 2024 10-K Table of Contents The Multi-Tranche Term Loan Agreement contains other covenants that, among other things, limit, in certain circumstances, our ability and/or the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to (1) create or incur certain liens and enter into sale and lease-back transactions, (2) create, assume, incur, or guarantee certain additional secured indebtedness and unsecured indebtedness of our restricted subsidiaries, and (3) consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer, lease, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets, to another entity. These covenants are subject to a number of limitations, exceptions, and qualifications. Our obligations under the Multi-Tranche Term Loan Agreement are unsecured. Revolving Credit Facility As of August 29, 2024, no amounts were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and $ 2.50 billion was available to us. Under the Revolving Credit Facility, borrowings would generally bear interest at a rate equal to adjusted term SOFR plus 1.00 % to 1.75 %, depending on our corporate credit ratings. Adjusted term SOFR for the Revolving Credit Facility agreement is the SOFR benchmark plus a credit spread adjustment ranging from approximately 0.11 % to 0.43 % depending on the applicable interest period selected. Any amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility would mature in May 2026 and amounts borrowed may be prepaid without penalty. The Revolving Credit Facility contains the same leverage ratio and substantially the same other covenants as the Multi-Tranche Term Loan Agreement. Maturities of Notes Payable As of August 29, 2024, maturities of notes payable by fiscal year were as follows: 2025 $ 107 2026 607 2027 1,780 2028 1,493 2029 700 2030 and thereafter 6,750 Unamortized issuance costs, discounts, and premium, net ( 34 ) Hedge accounting fair value adjustment ( 60 ) $ 11,343 Commitments As of August 29, 2024, we had noncancelable commitments with remaining contractual terms in excess of one year of approximately $ 6.7 billion for purchase obligations, of which approximately $ 1.7 billion will be due in 2025, $ 1.7 billion due in 2026, $ 1.0 billion due in 2027, $ 800 million due in 2028, $ 200 million due in 2029, and $ 1.3 billion due in 2030 and thereafter. Purchase obligations primarily include payments for goods or services with either a fixed or minimum quantity and price, which includes payments for the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment. Payments for leases that have been executed but have not yet commenced are excluded. In 2023, we entered into an 18 -year power purchase agreement in Singapore to purchase up to 450 megawatts of power at predominantly variable prices. This contract is expected to supply the majority of our power consumption needs in Singapore with more favorable pricing than our previous supply arrangements. 74 Table of Contents Contingencies We are currently a party to legal actions other than those described below arising from the normal course of business, none of which are expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Patent Matters As is typical in the semiconductor and other high-tech industries, from time to time, others have asserted, and may in the future assert, that our products or manufacturing processes infringe upon their intellectual property rights. A description of certain claims is below. On April 28, 2021, Netlist, Inc. (“Netlist”) filed two patent infringement actions against Micron, Micron Semiconductor Products, Inc. (“MSP”), and Micron Technology Texas, LLC (“MTEC”) in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. The first complaint alleges that one U.S. patent is infringed by certain of our non-volatile dual in-line memory modules. The second complaint alleges that three U.S. patents are infringed by certain of our load-reduced dual in-line memory modules (“LRDIMMs”). Each complaint seeks injunctive relief, damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. On March 31, 2022, Netlist filed a patent infringement complaint against Micron and Micron Semiconductor Germany, GmbH in Dusseldorf Regional Court alleging that two German patents are infringed by certain of our LRDIMMs. The complaint seeks damages, costs, and injunctive relief. On June 10, 2022, Netlist filed a patent infringement complaint against Micron, MSP, and MTEC in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (“E.D. Tex.”) alleging that six U.S. patents are infringed by certain of our memory modules and HBM products. On August 1, 2022, Netlist filed a second patent infringement complaint against the same defendants in E.D. Tex. alleging that one U.S. patent is infringed by certain of our LRDIMMs. On August 15, 2022, Netlist amended the second complaint to assert that two additional U.S. patents are infringed by certain of our LRDIMMs. The complaints in E.D. Tex. seek injunctive relief, damages, and attorneys’ fees. On May 23, 2024, following a four-day trial regarding the second complaint filed by Netlist in the E.D. Tex., a jury rendered a verdict that Micron’s memory modules infringe two asserted patents — U.S. Patent No. 7,619,912 (“the ‘912 patent”) and U.S. Patent No. 11,093,417 (“the ‘417 patent”) — and found that Micron should pay $ 425 million for infringement of the ‘912 patent and $ 20 million for infringement of the ‘417 patent. Micron expects to appeal the verdict. On April 17, 2024, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”) of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) issued a final written decision (“FWD”) finding unpatentable the sole asserted claim of the ‘912 patent. Netlist sought review of that ruling by the Director of the USPTO, which was denied on July 10, 2024. On July 30, 2024, the USPTO issued a FWD finding unpatentable all asserted claims of the ‘417 patent. In the case of each of the ‘912 and ‘417 patents, if the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirms the FWD, then the affirmed FWD will preclude any pending actions asserting infringement of such patent (including any infringement verdict that is subject to an ongoing appeal). On August 16, 2022, Sonrai Memory Ltd. filed a patent infringement complaint against Micron in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. The complaint alleged that two U.S. patents are infringed by certain SSD and NAND flash products. The complaint sought damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. On September 6, 2024, pursuant to a motion jointly filed by the parties, the court dismissed Sonrai’s complaint. On January 23, 2023, Besang Inc. filed a patent infringement complaint against Micron in the U.S. District Court for the E.D. Tex. The complaint alleges that one U.S. patent is infringed by certain of our 3D NAND and SSD products. The complaint seeks an injunction, damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. 75 | 2024 10-K Table of Contents On November 9, 2023, Yangtze Memory Technologies Company, Ltd. (“YMTC”) filed a patent infringement complaint against Micron and one of its subsidiaries in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (“N.D. Cal.”). The complaint alleges that eight U.S. patents are infringed by certain of our 3D NAND products. The complaint seeks an injunction, damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. On January 22, 2024, Micron Semiconductor (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. (“MSS”) was served with three patent infringement complaints filed by YMTC in Beijing Intellectual Property Court and on February 27, 2024, Micron Technology, Inc. (“MTI”) was served with the same complaints. The complaints assert that MTI and MSS infringed three Chinese patents owned by YMTC by importing, selling, offering for sale, and assisting others to sell certain 3D NAND products and SSDs in China. The complaint seeks an injunction, damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. On July 12, 2024, YMTC filed a second complaint against the Company and its subsidiary in N.D. Cal. The second complaint alleges that eleven U.S. patents are infringed by certain of our 3D NAND and DDR5 DRAM products. The complaint seeks an injunction, damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. On September 11, 2024, MSS was served with five patent infringement complaints filed by YMTC in Shanghai Intellectual Property Court. The complaints assert that MTI and MSS infringed five Chinese patents owned by YMTC by importing, selling, offering for sale, and assisting others to sell certain 3D NAND products and SSDs in China. The complaint seeks an injunction, damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. On June 3, 2024, MimirIP LLC (“MimirIP”) submitted a complaint to the United States International Trade Commission (“ITC”) alleging that certain of Micron’s DRAM and NAND products infringe six patents owned by MimirIP. The complaint requested the ITC to institute an investigation of such alleged infringement pursuant to Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 and to issue a permanent limited exclusion order barring from entry into the United States such allegedly infringing DRAM and NAND devices and electronic devices containing the same produced by several alleged customers of Micron. On August 27, 2024, MimirIP and the Company filed a joint motion to terminate the ITC investigation, which was granted on September 12, 2024. On June 3, 2024, MimirIP filed a complaint against Micron, two of its subsidiaries, and certain alleged customers of Micron in the E.D. Tex. alleging that the same six patents as are asserted in the ITC are infringed by certain of Micron’s DRAM and NAND products. The complaint sought damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. On August 30, 2024, the court dismissed the complaint pursuant to a notice of voluntary dismissal filed by MimirIP. On June 4, 2024, MimirIP filed a second complaint against Micron, two of its subsidiaries, and certain alleged customers of Micron in the E.D. Tex. alleging that six additional patents are infringed by certain of Micron’s DRAM and NAND products. The complaint sought damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. On August 30, 2024, the court dismissed the complaint pursuant to a notice of voluntary dismissal filed by MimirIP. The above lawsuits pertain to substantially all of our DRAM, NAND, and other memory and storage products we manufacture, which account for substantially all of our revenue. Antitrust Matters On May 15, 2018, the Chinese State Administration for Market Regulation (“SAMR”) notified Micron that it was investigating potential collusion and other anticompetitive conduct by DRAM suppliers in China. On May 31, 2018, SAMR made unannounced visits to our sales offices in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen to seek certain information as part of its investigation. We are cooperating with SAMR in its investigation. Other Matters In the normal course of business, we are a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify another party. It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these types of agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, our payments under these types of agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 76 Table of Contents Contingency Assessment We ar e unable to predict the outcome of any of the matters noted above and cannot make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of possible losses. A determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others or entering into a license agreement covering such intellectual property could result in significant liability and/or require us to make material changes to our products and/or manufacturing processes. Any of the foregoing, as well as the resolution of any other legal matter noted above, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Equity Common Stock Repurchases Our Board of Directors has authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to $ 10 billion of our outstanding common stock through open-market purchases, block trades, privately-negotiated transactions, derivative transactions, and/or pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date, does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, and is subject to market conditions and our ongoing determination of the best use of available cash. We repurchased 3.2 million shares of our common stock for $ 300 million in 2024 and 8.6 million shares for $ 425 million in 2023. Through August 29, 2024, we had repurchased an aggregate of $ 7.19 billion under the authorization. Amounts repurchased are included in treasury stock. Dividends In each quarter of 2024, we declared and paid dividends of $ 0.115 per share. On September 25, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $ 0.115 per share, payable in cash on October 23, 2024 , to shareholders of record as of the close of business on October 7, 2024 . Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by component for the year ended August 29, 2024 were as follows: Gains (Losses) on Derivative Instruments Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Investments Pension Liability Adjustments Cumulative Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment Total As of August 31, 2023 $ ( 304 ) $ ( 41 ) $ 36 $ ( 3 ) $ ( 312 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications 34 33 7 — 74 Amount reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 172 — ( 3 ) — 169 Tax effects ( 64 ) — ( 1 ) — ( 65 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) 142 33 3 — 178 As of August 29, 2024 $ ( 162 ) $ ( 8 ) $ 39 $ ( 3 ) $ ( 134 ) 77 | 2024 10-K Table of Contents Fair Value Measurements The estimated fair values and carrying values of our outstanding debt instruments were as follows: As of August 29, 2024 As of August 31, 2023 Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Notes $ 11,316 $ 11,343 $ 11,549 $ 12,049 The fair values of our debt instruments were estimated based on Level 2 inputs, including the trading price of our notes when available, discounted cash flows, and interest rates based on similar debt issued by parties with credit ratings similar to ours. Derivative Instruments Notional or Contractual Amount Fair Value (1) of Assets (2) Liabilities (3) As of August 29, 2024 Derivative instruments with hedge accounting designation Cash flow currency hedges $ 3,724 $ 57 $ ( 71 ) Cash flow commodity hedges 471 20 ( 7 ) Fair value currency hedges 2,511 — ( 41 ) Fair value interest rate hedges 900 — ( 60 ) Derivative instruments without hedge accounting designation Non-designated currency hedges 2,393 18 ( 3 ) $ 95 $ ( 182 ) As of August 31, 2023 Derivative instruments with hedge accounting designation Cash flow currency hedges $ 3,873 $ 16 $ ( 180 ) Cash flow commodity hedges 331 45 — Fair value interest rate hedges 900 — ( 100 ) Derivative instruments without hedge accounting designation Non-designated currency hedges 1,839 2 ( 17 ) $ 63 $ ( 297 ) (1) Forward and swap contracts are measured at fair value based on market-based observable inputs including market spot and forward rates, interest rates, and credit-risk spreads (Level 2). (2) Included in receivables and other noncurrent assets. (3) Included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other noncurrent liabilities. Derivative Instruments with Hedge Accounting Designation Cash Flow Hedges : We utilize forward and swap contracts that generally mature within two years designated as cash flow hedges to minimize our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates or commodity prices for certain capital expenditures and manufacturing costs. 78 Table of Contents The effects of cash flow hedging activities were as follows: For the year ended 2024 2023 2022 Gain (loss) from cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) $ 33 $ 30 $ ( 735 ) Gain (loss) excluded from effectiveness testing in cost of goods sold ( 135 ) ( 101 ) ( 32 ) Gain (loss) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings, primarily to cost of goods sold ( 172 ) ( 261 ) ( 53 ) As of August 29, 2024, we expect to reclassify $ 89 million of pre-tax losses related to cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings in the next 12 months. Fair Value Hedges : We utilize currency forward contracts that generally mature within one year designated as fair value hedges to minimize our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates for non-U.S.-dollar-denominated cash and investments in debt securities. The fair value of our hedged cash and investments in debt securities was $ 2.58 billion as of August 29, 2024. The changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as fair value hedges and the offsetting changes in the underlying fair values of the hedged items are both recognized in earnings. The effects of fair value currency hedges on our consolidated statements of operations, recognized in other non-operating income (expense), net, were not significant for the periods presented. We also utilize fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges to minimize certain exposures to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt that result from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates. We recognized interest expense of $ 96 million for changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps in 2022 and the impact to interest expense was not significant for 2024 or 2023. We also recognized offsetting reductions in interest expense of the same amounts related to the changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt for these periods. Derivative Instruments without Hedge Accounting Designation Currency Derivatives : We generally utilize a rolling hedge strategy with currency forward contracts that mature within three months to hedge our exposures of monetary assets and liabilities from changes in currency exchange rates. At the end of each reporting period, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are remeasured into U.S. dollars and the associated outstanding forward contracts are marked to market. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments without hedge accounting designation as well as the changes in the underlying monetary assets and liabilities from changes in currency exchange rates are included in other non-operating income (expense), net. The amounts recognized for derivative instruments without hedge accounting designation were not significant for the periods presented. We do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes. Derivative Counterparty Credit Risk and Master Netting Arrangements Our derivative instruments expose us to credit risk to the extent counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the contracts. Our maximum exposure to loss due to credit risk if counterparties fail completely to perform according to the terms of the contracts would generally equal the fair value of assets for these contracts as listed in the tables above. We seek to mitigate such risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions and by spreading risk across multiple financial institutions. As of August 29, 2024 and August 31, 2023, amounts netted under our master netting arrangements were not significant. Equity Compensation Plans As of August 29, 2024, 69 million shares of our common stock were available for future awards under our equity compensation plans, including 11 million shares approved for issuance under our employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”). 79 | 2024 10-K Table of Contents Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units (“Restricted Stock Awards”) As of August 29, 2024, there were 28 million shares of Restricted Stock Awards outstanding, 24 million of which are only subject to service-based vesting conditions. Service-based Restricted Stock Awards granted through October 2021 generally vest in one-fourth or one-third increments during each year of employment after the grant date. Service-based Restricted Stock Awards granted after October 2021 generally vest on 25 % or 33 % of the units granted after the first year and on 6.25 % or 8.33 % each quarter thereafter over the remaining three or two years of employment. Restricted Stock Awards with performance or market-based vesting conditions vest over a 3 -year period as conditions are met. At the end of the performance period, the number of actual shares to be awarded will vary between 0 % and 200 % of target amounts, depending upon the achievement level. In 2022, our Board of Directors approved dividend equivalent rights for unvested restricted stock units awarded on or after October 13, 2021. Restricted Stock Awards activity for 2024 is summarized as follows: Number of Shares Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share Outstanding as of August 31, 2023 29 $ 59.11 Granted 13 72.72 Vested ( 12 ) 57.92 Forfeited ( 2 ) 60.42 Outstanding as of August 29, 2024 28 65.82 For the year ended 2024 2023 2022 Restricted stock award shares granted 13 17 13 Weighted-average grant-date fair value per share $ 72.72 $ 55.99 $ 70.81 Aggregate vesting-date fair value of shares vested $ 1,008 $ 514 $ 498 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) Our ESPP is offered to substantially all employees and permitted eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock through payroll deductions of up to 15 % of their eligible compensation, subject to certain limitations. The purchase price of the shares under the ESPP equals 85 % of the lower of the fair market value of our common stock on either the first or last day of each six -month offering period. Compensation expense is calculated as of the beginning of the offering period as the fair value of the employees’ purchase rights utilizing the Black-Scholes option valuation model and is recognized over the offering period. Grant-date fair value and assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option valuation model were as follows: For the year ended 2024 2023 2022 Weighted-average grant-date fair value per share $ 26.82 $ 17.06 $ 18.87 Average expected life in years 0.5 0.5 0.5 Weighted-average expected volatility (based on implied volatility) 41 % 37 % 43 % Weighted-average risk-free interest rate 5.2 % 5.1 % 2.0 % Expected dividend yield 0.5 % 0.7 % 0.6 % Under the ESPP, employees purchased 4 million, 5 million, and 4 million shares of common stock in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, at a per share weighted average price of $ 65.72 , $ 51.93 , and $ 58.52 , respectively. Stock Options We last granted stock options in September 2018 and as of August 29, 2024, our outstanding stock options were not material. Stock options of 1.3 million shares were exercised in 2024. The total intrinsic value for options exercised was $ 92 million, $ 30 million, and $ 54 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. 80 Table of Contents Stock-based Compensation Expense For the year ended 2024 2023 2022 Stock-based compensation expense by caption Cost of goods sold $ 312 $ 201 $ 193 Research and development 296 226 175 Selling, general, and administrative 213 137 133 Restructure — ( 7 ) ( 5 ) $ 821 $ 557 $ 496 Stock-based compensation expense by type of award Restricted stock awards $ 749 $ 488 $ 429 ESPP 72 69 66 Stock options — — 1 $ 821 $ 557 $ 496 Income tax benefits related to the tax deductions for share-based awards are recognized only upon the settlement of the related share-based awards. Income tax benefits for share-based awards were $ 140 million, $ 68 million, and $ 77 million for 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense of $ 99 million and $ 88 million was capitalized and remained in inventory as of August 29, 2024 and August 31, 2023, respectively. As of August 29, 2024, $ 1.44 billion of total unrecognized compensation costs for unvested awards, before the effect of any future forfeitures, was expected to be recognized through the fourth quarter of 2028, resulting in a weighted-average period of 1.2 years. Employee Benefit Plans We have employee retirement plans at our U.S. and international sites. Details of significant plans are as follows: Employee Savings Plan for U.S. Employees We have a 401(k) retirement plan under which U.S. employees may contribute up to 75 % of their eligible pay, subject to Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limits, to various savings alternatives, none of which include direct investment in our stock. We match in cash eligible contributions from employees up to 5 % of the employee’s annual eligible earnings. Contribution expense for the 401(k) plan was $ 66 million, $ 59 million, and $ 66 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Retirement Plans We have pension plans available to employees at various foreign sites. As of August 29, 2024, the projected benefit obligations of our plans were $ 191 million and plan assets were $ 261 million. As of August 31, 2023, the projected benefit obligations of our plans were $ 175 million and plan assets were $ 232 million. Pension expense was not material for 2024, 2023, or 2022. 81 | 2024 10-K Table of Contents Government Incentives We receive incentives from governmental entities primarily in India, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, and the United States principally in the form of cash grants and tax credits. These incentives primarily relate to capital expenditures, have initial terms ranging from one year to 15 years, and may be subject to reimbursement if certain conditions are not met or maintained. The conditions attached to these incentives require us to incur expenditures related to the construction of new manufacturing facilities, the purchase and installation of specialized tools and equipment, R&D expenditures, and/or maintain certain levels of fixed asset investment or employee headcount during the incentive terms. The line items on the balance sheet affected by government incentives were as follows: As of August 29, 2024 Receivables $ 834 Other noncurrent assets 188 Noncurrent unearned government incentives 550 Beginning in 2023, we receive a 25 % investment tax credit on qualified investments in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing under the CHIPS Act. As qualified investments are made, we recognize investment tax credits in receivables or other noncurrent assets. We have signed a non-binding preliminary memorandum of terms with the U.S. Department of Commerce for up to $ 6.1 billion in direct funding under the CHIPS Act for our planned fab in Boise, Idaho and the first two planned fabs in Clay, New York. We are also eligible for federal loans up to $ 7.5 billion. We have also signed a non-binding term sheet with the state of New York that provides up to $ 5.5 billion in funding for the planned four-fab facility over the next 20-plus years through a combination of tax credits for qualified capital investments and incentives for eligible new job wages. In addition to the receivables and other noncurrent assets in the table above, as of August 29, 2024, we had aggregate commitments from various governmental entities of up to $ 3.4 billion to be received through 2033, subject to achievement of certain performance conditions. The commitment amount includes $ 1.8 billion ( 150 billion Indian rupees) for the construction of a new assembly and test facility in Gujarat, India. We will receive incentives representing 50 % of the total project cost from the Indian central government and 20 % of the total project cost from the state of Gujarat. The commitment amount also includes up to $ 1.3 billion ( 188 billion Japanese yen) from the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry to support the production of DRAM using EUV lithography in Hiroshima, Japan. Government incentives related to capital expenditures have reduced property, plant and equipment by $ 2.34 billion as of August 29, 2024, of which $ 1.10 billion pertained to 2024 expenditures. In 2024, operating income (loss) benefited by $ 588 million ( approximately 85 % in COGS and 15 % in R&D ) from government incentives recognized as a reduction of expense. 82 Table of Contents Revenue and Customer Contract Liabilities Revenue by Technology For the year ended 2024 2023 2022 DRAM $ 17,603 $ 10,978 $ 22,386 NAND 7,227 4,206 7,811 Other (primarily NOR) 281 356 561 $ 25,111 $ 15,540 $ 30,758 See “Segment and Other Information” for disclosure of disaggregated revenue by market segment. Revenue is primarily recognized at a point in time when control of the promised goods is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods. Substantially all contracts with our customers are short-term in duration at fixed, negotiated prices with payment generally due shortly after delivery. From time to time, we have contracts with initial terms that include performance obligations that extend beyond one year. As of August 29, 2024, our future performance obligations beyond one year were $ 141 million, which included customer prepayments and other contract liabilities. Customer prepayments made to secure product supply in future periods and other contract liabilities were $ 907 million as of August 29, 2024, of which $ 766 million was reported in other current liabilities and the remainder in other noncurrent liabilities. As of August 29, 2024 and August 31, 2023, other current liabilities included $ 718 million and $ 453 million, respectively, for estimates of consideration payable to customers including estimates for pricing adjustments and returns. In 2023, we received an aggregate of $ 228 million from settlements of insurance claims involving a power disruption in 2022 and an operational disruption in 2017, of which $ 186 million was for business interruption and recognized in revenue. Restructure and Asset Impairments For the year ended 2024 2023 2022 Employee severance $ 1 $ 163 $ — Asset impairments and other asset-related costs — 14 63 Other — ( 6 ) ( 15 ) $ 1 $ 171 $ 48 In 2023, we initiated a restructure plan in response to challenging industry conditions (the “2023 Restructure Plan”). Under the 2023 Restructure Plan, we reduced our headcount by approximately 15 % by the end of calendar 2023, through a combination of voluntary attrition and personnel reductions. The plan was substantially completed in 2023. Restructure and asset impairments for 2022 primarily related to the sale of our Lehi, Utah facility to Texas Instruments Incorporated. 83 | 2024 10-K Table of Contents Other Operating (Income) Expense, Net For the year ended 2024 2023 2022 Patent cross-license agreement gain $ ( 200 ) $ — $ — (Gain) loss on disposition of property, plant, and equipment ( 59 ) ( 54 ) ( 41 ) Goodwill impairment — 101 — Litigation settlement — 68 — Other 8 9 7 $ ( 251 ) $ 124 $ ( 34 ) We performed a qualitative assessment for goodwill impairment in 2024 and did not identify any impairment indicators for our reporting units. Due to 2023 global and macroeconomic challenges, as well as lower expected demand resulting from customer actions to reduce elevated inventory levels, we performed a 2023 quantitative assessment for goodwill impairment for each of our reporting units. We evaluated the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach, using a discounted cash flow methodology. We recognized a $ 101 million charge in 2023, included in other operating income (loss) to impair all of the goodwill assigned to our SBU reporting unit based on our best estimates of projected future cash flows at that time. The 2023 quantitative assessment for all of our other reporting units yielded fair values that substantially exceeded their carrying values. Income Taxes Our income tax (provision) benefit consisted of the following: For the year ended 2024 2023 2022 Income (loss) before income taxes and equity in net income (loss) of equity method investees U.S. $ 544 $ 235 $ 112 Foreign 696 ( 5,893 ) 9,459 $ 1,240 $ ( 5,658 ) $ 9,571 Income tax (provision) benefit Current U.S. federal $ ( 82 ) $ ( 5 ) $ ( 65 ) State ( 1 ) ( 1 ) ( 1 ) Foreign ( 333 ) ( 178 ) ( 528 ) ( 416 ) ( 184 ) ( 594 ) Deferred U.S. federal 18 ( 84 ) ( 166 ) State — — ( 225 ) Foreign ( 53 ) 91 97 ( 35 ) 7 ( 294 ) Income tax (provision) benefit $ ( 451 ) $ ( 177 ) $ ( 888 ) 84 Table of Contents The table below reconciles our tax (provision) benefit based on the U.S. federal statutory rate to our effective rate: For the year ended 2024 2023 2022 U.S. federal income tax (provision) benefit at statutory rate $ ( 260 ) 21.0 % $ 1,188 21.0 % $ ( 2,010 ) 21.0 % U.S. tax on foreign operations ( 7 ) 0.6 6 0.1 ( 322 ) 3.4 Change in valuation allowance ( 59 ) 4.8 ( 50 ) ( 0.9 ) ( 241 ) 2.5 Change in unrecognized tax benefits ( 41 ) 3.3 ( 30 ) ( 0.5 ) ( 67 ) 0.7 Foreign tax rate differential ( 214 ) 17.2 ( 1,285 ) ( 22.8 ) 1,601 ( 16.7 ) Research and development tax credits 76 ( 6.1 ) 43 0.8 66 ( 0.7 ) State taxes, net of federal benefit 12 ( 1.0 ) 37 0.7 — — Other 42 ( 3.4 ) ( 86 ) ( 1.5 ) 85 ( 0.9 ) Income tax (provision) benefit $ ( 451 ) 36.4 % $ ( 177 ) ( 3.1 ) % $ ( 888 ) 9.3 % We operate in a number of jurisdictions outside the United States, including Singapore, where we have tax incentive arrangements. These incentives expire, in whole or in part, at various dates through 2034 and are conditional, in part, upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds. As a result of low level of profitability and geographic mix of income, the benefit from tax incentive arrangements was not material for 2024 or 2023. These arrangements reduced our tax provision by $ 1.12 billion ($ 1.00 per diluted share) for 2022. As of August 29, 2024, certain non-U.S. subsidiaries had cumulative undistributed earnings of $ 4.12 billion that were deemed to be indefinitely reinvested. A provision has not been recognized to the extent that distributions from such subsidiaries are subject to additional foreign withholding or state income tax. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities related to investments in these foreign subsidiaries is not practicable. 85 | 2024 10-K Table of Contents Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes as well as carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities consist of the following: As of August 29, 2024 August 31, 2023 Deferred tax assets Net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards $ 1,050 $ 1,112 Accrued salaries, wages, and benefits 182 39 Operating lease liabilities 175 135 Inventories 4 52 Other 59 75 Gross deferred tax assets 1,470 1,413 Less valuation allowance ( 593 ) ( 528 ) Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance 877 885 Deferred tax liabilities Right-of-use assets ( 152 ) ( 115 ) Property, plant, and equipment ( 194 ) ( 31 ) Other ( 70 ) ( 100 ) Deferred tax liabilities ( 416 ) ( 246 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 461 $ 639 Reported as Deferred tax assets $ 520 $ 756 Deferred tax liabilities (included in other noncurrent liabilities) ( 59 ) ( 117 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 461 $ 639 We assess positive and negative evidence for each jurisdiction to determine whether it is more likely than not that existing deferred tax assets will be realized. As of August 29, 2024, and August 31, 2023, we had a valuation allowance of $ 593 million and $ 528 million, respectively, against our net deferred tax assets, primarily related to carryforwards in U.S. states and Malaysia. Changes in 2024 in the valuation allowance were due to adjustments based on management's assessment of the realizability of tax credits, allowances and net operating losses based on a level that is more likely than not to be realized. As of August 29, 2024, our net operating loss carryforward amounts and expiration periods, as reported to tax authorities, were as follows: Year of Expiration Malaysia Singapore State Japan Other Total 2025 - 2029 $ — $ — $ 47 $ 144 $ 3 $ 194 2030 - 2034 — — 298 325 126 749 2035 - 2039 — — 285 — — 285 2040 - 2044 — — 94 — — 94 Indefinite 1,224 765 — — — 1,989 $ 1,224 $ 765 $ 724 $ 469 $ 129 $ 3,311 86 Table of Contents As of August 29, 2024, our tax credit carryforward amounts and expiration periods, as reported to tax authorities, were as follows: Year of Tax Credit Expiration U.S. Federal State Other Total 2025 - 2029 $ — $ 61 $ — $ 61 2030 - 2034 47 134 2 183 2035 - 2039 48 140 44 232 2040 - 2045 315 6 — 321 Indefinite — 145 — 145 $ 410 $ 486 $ 46 $ 942 Below is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of our unrecognized tax benefits: For the year ended 2024 2023 2022 Beginning unrecognized tax benefits $ 744 $ 731 $ 660 Increases related to tax positions from prior years 2 2 14 Increases related to prior year tax positions taken in current year 20 27 — Increases related to tax positions taken in current year 54 17 80 Decreases related to tax positions from prior years ( 89 ) ( 33 ) ( 23 ) Decreases related to settlement with tax authorities ( 15 ) — — Ending unrecognized tax benefits $ 716 $ 744 $ 731 As of August 29, 2024, gross unrecognized tax benefits were $ 716 million, which would have an impact of approximately $ 633 million on our effective tax rate in the future, if recognized. Amounts accrued for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were not significant for any period presented. The resolution of tax audits or expiration of statute of limitations could also reduce our unrecognized tax benefits. Although the timing of final resolution is uncertain, the estimated potential reduction in our unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months would not be significant. We and our subsidiaries file income tax returns with the U.S. federal government, various U.S. states, and various foreign jurisdictions throughout the world. We regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters, including transfer pricing, and we continue to defend any and all such claims presented. Our U.S. federal and state tax returns remain open to examination for 2018 through 2024. We are currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service for our 2018 and 2019 tax years. In addition, tax returns that remain open to examination in Singapore, Taiwan and Japan range from the years 2016 to 2024. We believe that adequate amounts of taxes and related interest and penalties have been provided, and any adjustments as a result of examinations are not expected to materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.

We have the following four business units, which are our reportable segments: Compute and Networking Business Unit (“CNBU”) : Includes memory products and solutions sold into the data center, PC, graphics, and networking markets. Mobile Business Unit (“MBU”) : Includes memory and storage products sold into the smartphone and other mobile-device markets. Embedded Business Unit (“EBU”) : Includes memory and storage products and solutions sold into the intelligent edge through the automotive, industrial, and consumer embedded markets. Storage Business Unit (“SBU”) : Includes SSDs and component-level storage solutions sold into the data center, PC, and consumer markets. Certain operating expenses directly associated with the activities of a specific segment are charged to that segment. Other indirect operating income and expenses are generally allocated to segments based on their respective percentage of cost of goods sold or forecasted wafer production. We do not identify or report internally our assets (other than goodwill) or capital expenditures by segment, nor do we allocate gains and losses from equity method investments, interest, other non-operating income or expense items, or taxes to segments. As of August 29, 2024 and August 31, 2023, CNBU, MBU, and EBU had goodwill of $ 855 million, $ 198 million, and $ 97 million, respectively. 88 Table of Contents For the year ended 2024 2023 2022 Revenue CNBU $ 9,513 $ 5,710 $ 13,693 MBU 6,354 3,630 7,260 EBU 4,614 3,637 5,235 SBU 4,592 2,553 4,553 All Other 38 10 17 Total revenue $ 25,111 $ 15,540 $ 30,758 Operating income (loss) CNBU $ 980 $ ( 585 ) $ 5,844 MBU 114 ( 1,750 ) 2,160 EBU 199 382 1,752 SBU ( 362 ) ( 1,887 ) 513 All Other 17 8 12 948 ( 3,832 ) 10,281 Unallocated Lower costs from sale of inventory written down in prior periods 987 844 — Patent cross-license agreement 200 — — Stock-based compensation ( 821 ) ( 564 ) ( 501 ) Restructure and asset impairment ( 1 ) ( 171 ) ( 48 ) Provision to write down inventories to net realizable value — ( 1,831 ) — Goodwill impairment — ( 101 ) — Litigation settlement — ( 68 ) — Other ( 9 ) ( 22 ) ( 30 ) 356 ( 1,913 ) ( 579 ) Total operating income (loss) $ 1,304 $ ( 5,745 ) $ 9,702 Depreciation and amortization expense included in operating income (loss) was as follows: For the year ended 2024 2023 2022 CNBU $ 2,760 $ 2,512 $ 2,766 MBU 2,002 2,149 1,725 EBU 1,491 1,324 1,280 SBU 1,501 1,751 1,323 All Other 8 1 2 Unallocated 18 19 20 $ 7,780 $ 7,756 $ 7,116 89 | 2024 10-K Table of Contents Certain Concentrations Revenue by market segment as a percent of total revenue, rounded to the nearest 5%, is presented in the table below: For the year ended 2024 2023 2022 Data center and networking 35 % 25 % 35 % Mobile 25 % 25 % 25 % PC, graphics, and other 25 % 30 % 25 % Intelligent edge – automotive, industrial, and consumer embedded 20 % 25 % 15 % Percentages of total revenue may not total 100% due to rounding. Revenue from one customer was 10 % (primarily included in MBU, EBU, and CNBU segments) of total revenue for 2024. No customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue in 2023. Revenue from one customer was 12 % (primarily included in CNBU and SBU segments) and another customer was 11 % (primarily included in MBU, CNBU, and EBU segments) of total revenue in 2022. We generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and production equipment; however, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials and production equipment that meet our standards and, in some cases, materials or production equipment are provided by a single supplier. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, money market accounts, certificates of deposit, fixed-rate debt securities, trade receivables, share repurchase, and derivative contracts. We invest through high-credit-quality financial institutions and, by policy, generally limit the concentration of credit exposure by restricting investments with any single obligor and monitor credit risk of bank counterparties on an ongoing basis. A concentration of credit risk may exist with respect to receivables of certain customers. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of customers worldwide and generally do not require collateral from our customers. Historically, we have not experienced material losses on receivables. A concentration of risk may also exist with respect to our derivative hedging programs as the number of counterparties to our hedges is limited and the notional amounts are relatively large. We seek to mitigate such risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions and through entering into master netting arrangements. 90 Table of Contents Geographic Information Revenue based on the geographic location of our customers’ headquarters was as follows: For the year ended 2024 2023 2022 United States $ 13,168 $ 7,805 $ 16,026 Taiwan 4,708 2,697 6,185 Mainland China (excluding Hong Kong) 3,045 2,181 3,311 Other Asia Pacific 1,330 752 1,223 Hong Kong 1,071 340 1,665 Japan 840 987 1,696 Europe 818 682 505 Other 131 96 147 $ 25,111 $ 15,540 $ 30,758 Long-lived assets by geographic area consisted of property, plant, and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets and were as follows: As of August 29, 2024 August 31, 2023 Taiwan $ 14,156 $ 12,926 Singapore 10,588 11,283 Japan 7,085 7,323 United States 6,508 5,196 Malaysia 1,153 1,124 China 486 395 India 338 277 Other 80 70 $ 40,394 $ 38,594 91 | 2024 10-K Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Micron Technology, Inc. Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Micron Technology, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of August 29, 2024 and August 31, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income (loss), of changes in equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 29, 2024, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for each of the three years in the period ended August 29, 2024 appearing under Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of August 29, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of August 29, 2024 and August 31, 2023 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 29, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 29, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 92 Table of Contents Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Net Realizable Value of Finished Goods and Work in Process Inventories As described in the Inventories note to the consolidated financial statements, as of August 29, 2024, the Company had a net inventory balance for finished goods and work in process inventory totaling $8.1 billion. As disclosed by management, determining the net realizable value of the Company's finished goods and work in process inventories involves significant judgments, including projecting future average selling prices, future sales volumes, and future cost per part. Differences in future average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of finished goods and work in process inventories and accordingly the amount of write-down recorded. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the net realizable value of finished goods and work in process inventories is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in determining the net realizable value of finished goods and work in process inventories and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumption related to future average selling prices. 93 | 2024 10-K Table of Contents Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s determination of the net realizable value of finished goods and work in process inventories. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management's process for determining the net realizable value of finished goods and work in process inventories; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of management’s methodology; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in determining the net realizable value; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management's significant assumption related to future average selling prices. Evaluating management's assumption related to future average selling prices involved considering (i) current and past sales (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; (iii) a comparison of the prior year estimates to actual average selling prices in the current fiscal year; and (iv) whether the assumption was consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP San Jose, California October 4, 2024 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1984. 94 Table of Contents ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES An evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that those disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. During the fourth quarter of 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of August 29, 2024. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of August 29, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K. 95 | 2024 10-K Table of Contents ITEM 9B.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (All tabular amounts in millions, except per share amounts) (Unaudited) Significant Accounting Policies For a discussion of our significant accounting policies, see “Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Significant Accounting Policies” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2023. There have been no changes to our significant accounting policies since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2023. Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Micron Technology, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) consistent in all material respects with those applied in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2023. In the opinion of our management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all necessary adjustments, consisting of a normal recurring nature, to fairly state the financial information set forth herein. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to current period presentation. Our fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period ending on the Thursday closest to August 31. Fiscal years 2024 and 2023 each contain 52 weeks. All period references are to our fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated. These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2023. Variable Interest Entities A number of special purpose entities (the \"Lease SPEs\") were created by a third-party to facilitate equipment lease financing transactions between us and financial institutions that fund the lease financing transactions (\"Financing Entities\"). Neither we nor the Financing Entities have an equity interest in the Lease SPEs. The Lease SPEs are variable interest entities because their equity is not sufficient to permit them to finance their activities without additional support from the Financing Entities and because the third-party equity holder lacks characteristics of a controlling financial interest. By design, the arrangements with the Lease SPEs are merely financing vehicles and we do not bear any significant risks from variable interests with the Lease SPEs. We have determined that we do not have the power to direct the activities of the Lease SPEs that most significantly impact their economic performance and we do not consolidate the Lease SPEs. As of February 29, 2024, we had approximately $ 370 million of financial lease liabilities and right-of-use assets under these arrangements. 11 | 2024 Q2 10-Q Table of Contents Cash and Investments All of our short-term investments and long-term marketable investments were classified as available-for-sale as of the dates noted below. Cash and equivalents and the fair values of our available-for-sale investments, which approximated amortized costs, were as follows: As of February 29, 2024 As of August 31, 2023 Cash and Equivalents Short-term Investments Long-term Marketable Investments (1) Total Fair Value Cash and Equivalents Short-term Investments Long-term Marketable Investments (1) Total Fair Value Cash $ 5,588 $ — $ — $ 5,588 $ 5,771 $ — $ — $ 5,771 Level 1 (2) Money market funds 1,204 — — 1,204 1,629 — — 1,629 Level 2 (3) Certificates of deposit 1,220 11 — 1,231 1,172 25 — 1,197 Corporate bonds — 606 286 892 — 737 437 1,174 Asset-backed securities — 17 330 347 — 15 387 402 Commercial paper 3 183 — 186 — 109 — 109 Government securities 1 173 11 185 5 131 20 156 8,016 $ 990 $ 627 $ 9,633 8,577 $ 1,017 $ 844 $ 10,438 Restricted cash (4) 85 79 Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 8,101 $ 8,656 (1) The maturities of long-term marketable investments primarily range from one to five years , except for asset-backed securities which are not due at a single maturity date. (2) The fair value of Level 1 securities is measured based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. (3) The fair value of Level 2 securities is measured using information obtained from pricing services, which obtain quoted market prices for similar instruments, non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data, or various other methodologies, to determine the appropriate value at the measurement date. We perform supplemental analysis to validate information obtained from these pricing services. No adjustments were made to the fair values indicated by such pricing information as of February 29, 2024 or August 31, 2023. (4) Restricted cash is included in other current assets and other noncurrent assets and primarily relates to certain government incentives received prior to being earned and for which restrictions lapse upon achieving certain performance conditions or which will be returned if performance conditions are not met. Gross realized gains and losses from sales of available-for-sale securities were not significant for any period presented. Non-marketable Equity Investments In addition to the amounts included in the table above, we had $ 189 million and $ 218 million of non-marketable equity investments without a readily determinable fair value that were included in other noncurrent assets as of February 29, 2024 and August 31, 2023, respectively. We recognized a loss in other non-operating income (expense) on our non-marketable investments of $ 31 million for the first quarter of 2024. The amounts recognized for the other periods presented were not significant. Our non-marketable equity investments are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis and classified as Level 3. 12 Table of Contents Receivables As of February 29, 2024 August 31, 2023 Trade receivables $ 3,648 $ 2,048 Income and other taxes 188 194 Other 460 201 $ 4,296 $ 2,443 Inventories As of February 29, 2024 August 31, 2023 Finished goods $ 1,132 $ 1,616 Work in process 6,622 6,111 Raw materials and supplies 689 660 $ 8,443 $ 8,387 Property, Plant, and Equipment As of February 29, 2024 August 31, 2023 Land $ 283 $ 283 Buildings 18,963 17,967 Equipment (1) 67,273 65,555 Construction in progress (2) 2,636 2,464 Software 1,393 1,316 90,548 87,585 Accumulated depreciation ( 52,961 ) ( 49,657 ) $ 37,587 $ 37,928 (1) Includes costs related to equipment not placed into service of $ 2.27 billion as of February 29, 2024 and $ 2.91 billion as of August 31, 2023.

The resulting variable interest paid is at a rate equal to SOFR plus approximately 3.33 %. The fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges, and as a result, the carrying values of our 2027 Notes reflect adjustments in fair value. Debt Activity The table below presents the effects of debt financing and prepayment activities in the first six months of 2024: Transaction Date Increase (Decrease) in Principal Increase (Decrease) in Carrying Value Increase (Decrease) in Cash Issuance 2031 Notes January 12, 2024 $ 1,000 $ 993 $ 993 Prepayments 2024 Term Loan A January 12, 2024 ( 588 ) ( 587 ) ( 588 ) 2025 Term Loan A January 12, 2024 ( 402 ) ( 401 ) ( 402 ) $ 10 $ 5 $ 3 2031 Notes On January 12, 2024, we issued $ 1.00 billion principal amount of senior unsecured 2031 Notes in a public offering. The 2031 Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.300% per year and will mature on January 15, 2031. Issuance costs and debt discount for the 2031 Notes were $ 7 million. 16 Table of Contents We may redeem the 2031 Notes, in whole or in part, at our option prior to their maturity dates at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100 % of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed and (ii) the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest, plus accrued interest in each case. We may also redeem the 2031 Notes, in whole or in part, at a price equal to par two months prior to maturity in accordance with the terms of the 2031 Notes. The 2031 Notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit, in certain circumstances, our ability and/or the ability of our restricted subsidiaries (which are generally domestic subsidiaries in which we own at least 80 % of the voting stock and which own principal property, as defined in the indenture governing the 2031 Notes) to (1) create or incur certain liens; (2) enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions; and (3) consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer, or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets, to another entity. These covenants are subject to a number of limitations and exceptions. Additionally, if a change of control triggering event occurs, as defined in the indenture governing the 2031 Notes, we will be required to offer to purchase the 2031 Notes at 101 % of the outstanding aggregate principal amount plus accrued interest up to the purchase date. Revolving Credit Facility As of February 29, 2024, no amounts were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and $ 2.50 billion was available to us. Under the Revolving Credit Facility, borrowings would generally bear interest at a rate equal to adjusted term SOFR plus 1.00 % to 1.75 %, depending on our corporate credit ratings. Adjusted term SOFR for the Revolving Credit Facility agreement is the SOFR benchmark plus a credit spread adjustment ranging from approximately 0.11 % to 0.43 % depending on the applicable interest period selected. Any amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility would mature in May 2026 and amounts borrowed may be prepaid without penalty. The Revolving Credit Facility requires us to maintain, on a consolidated basis, a leverage ratio of total indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility and calculated as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, not to exceed 3.25 to 1.00. On March 27, 2023, we amended the Revolving Credit Facility to provide that in lieu of the foregoing leverage ratio, during the fourth quarter of 2023 and each quarter of 2024, we will be required to maintain, on a consolidated basis, a net leverage ratio of total net indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility and calculated as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, not to exceed 3.25 to 1.00. Alternatively, for up to three of such five quarters, we may elect to comply with a requirement of minimum liquidity, as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility, of not less than $ 5.0 billion. Through the second quarter of 2024, we complied with the net leverage ratio requirement. Each of the leverage ratio and net leverage ratio maximums, as applicable, is subject to a temporary four quarter increase in such ratio to 3.75 to 1.00 following certain material acquisitions. Maturities of Notes Payable As of February 29, 2024, maturities of notes payable by fiscal year were as follows: Remainder of 2024 $ 54 2025 107 2026 1,257 2027 1,780 2028 1,493 2029 and thereafter 7,450 Unamortized issuance costs, discounts, and premium, net ( 37 ) Hedge accounting fair value adjustment ( 86 ) $ 12,018 17 | 2024 Q2 10-Q Table of Contents Contingencies We are currently a party to legal actions other than those described below arising from the normal course of business, none of which are expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Patent Matters As is typical in the semiconductor and other high-tech industries, from time to time, others have asserted, and may in the future assert, that our products or manufacturing processes infringe upon their intellectual property rights. A description of certain claims is below. On March 19, 2018, Micron Semiconductor (Xi’an) Co., Ltd. (“MXA”) was served with a patent infringement complaint filed by Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co., Ltd. (“Jinhua”) in the Fuzhou Intermediate People’s Court in Fujian Province, China (the “Fuzhou Court”). On April 3, 2018, Micron Semiconductor (Shanghai) Co. Ltd.

The complaint alleges that one U.S. patent is infringed by certain of our 3D NAND and SSD products. The complaint seeks an injunction, damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. On November 9, 2023, Yangtze Memory Technologies Company, Ltd. (“YMTC”) filed a patent infringement complaint against Micron and one of its subsidiaries in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaint alleges that eight U.S. patents are infringed by certain of our 3D NAND products. The complaint seeks an injunction, damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. On January 22, 2024, Micron Semiconductor (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. (“MSS”) was served with three patent infringement complaints filed by YMTC in Beijing Intellectual Property Court and on February 27, 2024, Micron Technology, Inc. (“MTI”) was served with the same complaints. The complaints assert that MTI and MSS infringed three Chinese patents owned by YMTC by importing, selling, offering for sale, and assisting others to sell certain 3D NAND products and SSDs in China. The complaint seeks an injunction, damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. The above lawsuits pertain to substantially all of our DRAM, NAND, and other memory and storage products we manufacture, which account for substantially all of our revenue. Antitrust Matters Six cases were filed against Micron alleging price fixing of DRAM products in the following Canadian courts on the dates indicated: Superior Court of Quebec (April 30, 2018 and May 3, 2018), the Federal Court of Canada (May 2, 2018), the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (May 15, 2018), and the Supreme Court of British Columbia (May 10, 2018). The plaintiffs in these cases are individuals seeking certification of class actions on behalf of direct and indirect purchasers of DRAM in Canada (or regions of Canada) between June 1, 2016 and February 1, 2018. Certification of class action status was denied in two of the cases. All six cases are now either inactive or have been dismissed. On May 15, 2018, the Chinese State Administration for Market Regulation (“SAMR”) notified Micron that it was investigating potential collusion and other anticompetitive conduct by DRAM suppliers in China. On May 31, 2018, SAMR made unannounced visits to our sales offices in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen to seek certain information as part of its investigation. We are cooperating with SAMR in its investigation. 19 | 2024 Q2 10-Q Table of Contents Other Matters In the normal course of business, we are a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify another party. It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these types of agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, our payments under these types of agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Contingency Assessment We ar e unable to predict the outcome of any of the matters noted above and cannot make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of possible losses. A determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others or entering into a license agreement covering such intellectual property could result in significant liability and/or require us to make material changes to our products and/or manufacturing processes. Any of the foregoing, as well as the resolution of any other legal matter noted above, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Equity Common Stock Repurchases In May 2018, our Board of Directors authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to $ 10 billion of our outstanding common stock through open-market purchases, block trades, privately-negotiated transactions, derivative transactions, and/or pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date, does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, and is subject to market conditions and our ongoing determination of the best use of available cash. No shares were repurchased in the first six months of 2024. Through February 29, 2024, we had repurchased an aggregate of $ 6.89 billion under the authorization. Amounts repurchased are included in treasury stock. Dividends We paid dividends of $ 127 million ($ 0.115 per share) and $ 129 million ($ 0.115 per share) in the second and first quarters of 2024, respectively. On March 20, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $ 0.115 per share, payable in cash on April 16, 2024 , to shareholders of record as of the close of business on April 1, 2024 . Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by component for the six months ended February 29, 2024 were as follows: Gains (Losses) on Derivative Instruments Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Investments Pension Liability Adjustments Cumulative Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment Total As of August 31, 2023 $ ( 304 ) $ ( 41 ) $ 36 $ ( 3 ) $ ( 312 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ( 50 ) 16 — — ( 34 ) Amount reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 100 — ( 2 ) — 98 Tax effects ( 17 ) — 1 — ( 16 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) 33 16 ( 1 ) — 48 As of February 29, 2024 $ ( 271 ) $ ( 25 ) $ 35 $ ( 3 ) $ ( 264 ) 20 Table of Contents Fair Value Measurements The estimated fair values and carrying values of our outstanding debt instruments were as follows: As of February 29, 2024 As of August 31, 2023 Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Notes $ 11,733 $ 12,018 $ 11,549 $ 12,049 The fair values of our debt instruments were estimated based on Level 2 inputs, including the trading price of our notes when available, discounted cash flows, and interest rates based on similar debt issued by parties with credit ratings similar to ours. Derivative Instruments Notional or Contractual Amount Fair Value of Assets (1) Liabilities (2) As of February 29, 2024 Derivative instruments with hedge accounting designation Cash flow currency hedges $ 4,028 $ 8 $ ( 173 ) Cash flow commodity hedges 393 25 ( 1 ) Fair value interest rate hedges 900 — ( 86 ) Derivative instruments without hedge accounting designation Non-designated currency hedges 2,061 3 ( 15 ) $ 36 $ ( 275 ) As of August 31, 2023 Derivative instruments with hedge accounting designation Cash flow currency hedges $ 3,873 $ 16 $ ( 180 ) Cash flow commodity hedges 331 45 — Fair value interest rate hedges 900 — ( 100 ) Derivative instruments without hedge accounting designation Non-designated currency hedges 1,839 2 ( 17 ) $ 63 $ ( 297 ) (1) Included in receivables and other noncurrent assets. (2) Included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other noncurrent liabilities. Derivative Instruments with Hedge Accounting Designation Cash Flow Hedges : We utilize forward and swap contracts that generally mature within two years designated as cash flow hedges to minimize our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates or commodity prices for certain capital expenditures and manufacturing costs. Forward and swap contracts are measured at fair value based on market-based observable inputs including market spot and forward rates, interest rates, and credit-risk spreads (Level 2). We recognized gains from cash flow hedges of $ 75 million and $ 128 million for the second quarter and first six months of 2023, respectively, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The amounts recognized for the second quarter and first six months of 2024 were not significant. 21 | 2024 Q2 10-Q Table of Contents For forward points excluded from our effectiveness testing, we recognized losses of $ 34 million and $ 70 million for the second quarter and first six months of 2024, respectively, in cost of goods sold. The amounts recognized for the second quarter and first six months of 2023 were not significant. We reclassified losses of $ 56 million and $ 100 million for the second quarter and first six months of 2024, respectively, and losses of $ 54 million and $ 122 million for the second quarter and first six months of 2023, respectively, from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings, primarily to cost of goods sold. As of February 29, 2024, we expect to reclassify $ 126 million of pre-tax losses related to cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings in the next 12 months. Fair Value Hedges : We utilize fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges to minimize certain exposures to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt that result from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates. Interest rate swaps are measured at fair value based on market-based observable inputs including interest rates and credit-risk spreads (Level 2). The changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as fair value hedges and the offsetting changes in the underlying fair values of the hedged items are both recognized in earnings. When a derivative is no longer designated as a fair value hedge for any reason, including termination and maturity, the remaining unamortized difference between the carrying value of the hedged item at that time and the face value of the hedged item is amortized to earnings over the remaining life of the hedged item, or immediately if the hedged item has matured or been extinguished. The effects of fair value hedges on our consolidated statements of operations, recognized in interest expense, were not significant for the periods presented. Derivative Instruments without Hedge Accounting Designation Currency Derivatives : We generally utilize a rolling hedge strategy with currency forward contracts that mature within three months to hedge our exposures of monetary assets and liabilities from changes in currency exchange rates. At the end of each reporting period, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are remeasured into U.S. dollars and the associated outstanding forward contracts are marked to market. Currency forward contracts are valued at fair values based on the middle of bid and ask prices of dealers or exchange quotations (Level 2). Realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments without hedge accounting designation as well as the changes in the underlying monetary assets and liabilities from changes in currency exchange rates are included in other non-operating income (expense), net. The amounts recognized for derivative instruments without hedge accounting designation were not significant for the periods presented. We do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes. Equity Plans As of February 29, 2024, 72 million shares of our common stock were available for future awards under our equity plans, including 12 million shares approved for issuance under our employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”). Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units (“Restricted Stock Awards”) Restricted Stock Awards activity is summarized as follows: Six months ended February 29, 2024 March 2, 2023 Restricted stock award shares granted 12 14 Weighted-average grant-date fair value per share $ 67.78 $ 54.00 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) For each six-month ESPP offering period that ended in the second quarter of 2024 and 2023, employees purchased 2 million and 3 million shares, respectively, at a share price of $ 60.68 and $ 52.45 , respectively. 22 Table of Contents Stock-based Compensation Expense Stock-based compensation expense recognized in our statements of operations is presented below. Stock-based compensation expense of $ 98 million and $ 88 million was capitalized and remained in inventory as of February 29, 2024 and August 31, 2023, respectively.

Revenue and Customer Contract Liabilities Revenue is primarily recognized at a point in time when control of the promised goods is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods. Substantially all contracts with our customers are short-term in duration at fixed, negotiated prices with payment generally due shortly after delivery. From time to time, we have contracts with initial terms that include performance obligations that extend beyond one year. As of February 29, 2024, our future performance obligations beyond one year were not significant. Revenue by Technology Quarter ended Six months ended February 29, 2024 March 2, 2023 February 29, 2024 March 2, 2023 DRAM $ 4,158 $ 2,722 $ 7,585 $ 5,551 NAND 1,567 885 2,797 1,988 Other (primarily NOR) 99 86 168 239 $ 5,824 $ 3,693 $ 10,550 $ 7,778 See “Segment and Other Information” for disclosure of disaggregated revenue by market segment. 23 | 2024 Q2 10-Q Table of Contents Customer Contract Liabilities Contract liabilities from customer prepayments made to secure product supply in future periods were approximately $ 600 million as of February 29, 2024 and were reported within other current liabilities. As of February 29, 2024 and August 31, 2023, other current liabilities also included $ 562 million and $ 453 million, respectively, for estimates of consideration payable to customers including estimates for pricing adjustments and returns. Restructure and Asset Impairments Quarter ended Six months ended February 29, 2024 March 2, 2023 February 29, 2024 March 2, 2023 Employee severance $ — $ 80 $ — $ 93 Asset impairments and other asset-related costs — 8 — 8 Other — ( 2 ) — ( 2 ) $ — $ 86 $ — $ 99 In 2023, we initiated a restructure plan in response to challenging industry conditions (the “2023 Restructure Plan”). Under the 2023 Restructure Plan, we reduced our headcount by approximately 15 % by the end of calendar 2023, through a combination of voluntary attrition and personnel reductions. The plan was substantially completed in 2023. Other Operating (Income) Expense, Net Quarter ended Six months ended February 29, 2024 March 2, 2023 February 29, 2024 March 2, 2023 Patent cross-license agreement gain $ ( 200 ) $ — $ ( 200 ) $ — (Gain) loss on disposition of property, plant, and equipment ( 9 ) ( 9 ) ( 25 ) ( 22 ) Other ( 15 ) 1 ( 14 ) 3 $ ( 224 ) $ ( 8 ) $ ( 239 ) $ ( 19 ) Income Taxes Our income tax (provision) benefit consisted of the following: Quarter ended Six months ended February 29, 2024 March 2, 2023 February 29, 2024 March 2, 2023 Income (loss) before taxes $ 170 $ ( 2,271 ) $ ( 985 ) $ ( 2,447 ) Income tax (provision) benefit 622 ( 54 ) 549 ( 62 ) Effective tax rate ( 365.9 ) % ( 2.4 ) % 55.7 % ( 2.5 ) % 24 Table of Contents In the first quarter of 2024, our tax expense was based on actual results for jurisdictions where small changes in our projected pre-tax income would have caused significant changes in the estimated annual effective tax rate. With our improved fiscal 2024 outlook, we can now estimate a more reliable annual effective tax rate and have reverted to a global annual effective tax rate method for all jurisdictions. Applying this updated rate to our year-to-date earnings resulted in the tax benefit of $ 622 million recognized in the second quarter of 2024. The change in our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2024 as compared to the first quarter of 2024 was primarily due to the use of the estimated annual effective tax rate for the quarter. The change in our effective tax rate for the first six months of 2024 as compared to the first six months of 2023 was primarily due to changes in levels of profitability and the geographic mix of earnings. We operate in a number of jurisdictions outside the United States, including Singapore, where we have tax incentive arrangements. These incentives expire, in whole or in part, at various dates through 2034 and are conditional, in part, upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds. As a result of the low level of profitability and the geographic mix of income, the benefit from tax incentive arrangements was not material for the periods presented. As of February 29, 2024, other current assets included $ 882 million related to income taxes. Earnings Per Share Quarter ended Six months ended February 29, 2024 March 2, 2023 February 29, 2024 March 2, 2023 Net income (loss) – Basic and Diluted $ 793 $ ( 2,312 ) $ ( 441 ) $ ( 2,507 ) Weighted-average common shares outstanding – Basic 1,104 1,091 1,102 1,091 Dilutive effect of equity plans 10 — — — Weighted-average common shares outstanding – Diluted 1,114 1,091 1,102 1,091 Earnings (loss) per share Basic $ 0.72 $ ( 2.12 ) $ ( 0.40 ) $ ( 2.30 ) Diluted 0.71 ( 2.12 ) ( 0.40 ) ( 2.30 ) Antidilutive potential common shares excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share, that could dilute basic earnings per share in the future, were 4 million and 33 million for the second quarter and first six months of 2024, respectively, and were 33 million and 34 million for the second quarter and first six months of 2023, respectively.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2023. All period references are to our fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated. Our fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period ending on the Thursday closest to August 31. Fiscal 2024 and 2023 each contain 52 weeks. All tabular dollar amounts are in millions, except per share amounts. Overview We are an industry leader in innovative memory and storage solutions transforming how the world uses information to enrich life for all . With a relentless focus on our customers, technology leadership, and manufacturing and operational excellence, Micron delivers a rich portfolio of high-performance DRAM, NAND, and NOR memory and storage products through our Micron® and Crucial® brands. Every day, the innovations that our people create fuel the data economy, enabling advances in artificial intelligence and 5G applications that unleash opportunities — from the data center to the intelligent edge and across the client and mobile user experience. We manufacture our products at wholly-owned facilities and also utilize subcontractors for certain manufacturing processes. Our global network of manufacturing centers of excellence not only allows us to benefit from scale while streamlining processes and operations, but it also brings together some of the world’s brightest talent to work on the most advanced memory technology. Centers of excellence bring expertise together in one location, providing an efficient support structure for end-to-end manufacturing, with quicker cycle times, in partnership with teams such as research and development (“R&D”), product development, human resources, procurement, and supply chain. For our locations in Singapore and Taiwan, this is also a combination of bringing fabrication and back-end manufacturing together. We make significant investments to develop proprietary product and process technology, which generally increases bit density per wafer and reduces per-bit manufacturing costs of each generation of product. We continue to introduce new generations of products that offer improved performance characteristics, including higher data transfer rates, advanced packaging solutions, lower power consumption, improved read/write reliability, and increased memory density. We face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets. To remain competitive we must continuously develop and implement new products and technologies and decrease manufacturing costs in spite of ongoing inflationary cost pressures. Our success is largely dependent on obtaining returns on our R&D investments, efficient utilization of our manufacturing infrastructure, development and integration of advanced product and process technologies, market acceptance of our diversified portfolio of semiconductor-based memory and storage solutions, and efficient capital spending. Product Technologies Our product portfolio of memory and storage solutions, advanced solutions, and storage platforms is based on our high-performance semiconductor memory and storage technologies, including DRAM, NAND, and NOR. We sell our products into various markets through our business units in numerous forms, including components, modules, SSDs, managed NAND, MCPs, HBM, and wafers. Our system-level solutions, including SSDs and managed NAND, combine NAND, a controller, firmware, and in some cases DRAM. DRAM : DRAM products are dynamic random access memory semiconductor devices with low latency that provide high-speed data retrieval with a variety of performance characteristics. DRAM products lose content when power is turned off (“volatile”) and are most commonly used in client, cloud server, enterprise, networking, graphics, industrial, and automotive markets. LPDRAM products, which are engineered to meet standards for performance and power consumption, are sold into smartphone and other mobile-device markets (including client markets for Chromebooks, notebook PCs, and gaming consoles), as well as into the automotive, industrial, consumer, and datacenter markets. HBM is a stacked DRAM technology optimized for memory-bandwidth intensive applications. 27 | 2024 Q2 10-Q Table of Contents NAND : NAND products are non-volatile, re-writeable semiconductor storage devices that provide high-capacity, low-cost storage with a variety of performance characteristics. NAND is used in SSDs for the enterprise and cloud, client, consumer, and automotive markets and in removable storage markets. Managed NAND is used in smartphones and other mobile devices, and in consumer, automotive, and embedded markets. Low-density NAND is ideal for applications like automotive, surveillance, machine-to-machine, automation, printer, and home networking. NOR : NOR products are non-volatile, re-writable semiconductor memory devices that provide fast read speeds. NOR is most commonly used for reliable code storage (e.g., boot, application, operating system, and execute-in-place code in an embedded system) and for frequently changing small data storage and is ideal for automotive, industrial, and consumer applications. Industry Conditions The memory and storage industry environment deteriorated sharply in the fourth quarter of 2022 and through 2023 due to weak demand in many end markets combined with global and macroeconomic challenges and lower demand resulting from customer actions to reduce inventory levels. This led to significant reductions in average selling prices for both DRAM and NAND and reductions in bit shipments for DRAM, resulting in declines in revenue across all our business segments and nearly all our end markets. For the first six months of 2024, increasing demand growth, driven in part by deployment of artificial intelligence and mostly normal customer inventories, combined with industry-wide supply discipline, resulted in an improved industry supply and demand balance. As a result, we have experienced improvements in pricing and margins in 2024. We reduced capital expenditures and wafer starts for both DRAM and NAND in response to challenging market conditions that began in the latter part of 2022 and increased levels of our inventories. In the first quarter of 2024, we recognized $165 million of period costs due to wafer start reductions. In the second quarter of 2024, fabrication facility underutilization was reduced and principally related to legacy manufacturing capacity, accordingly period costs were not significant. In addition, to improve capital efficiency, we have redeployed equipment from older technology nodes to support conversions to leading-edge nodes, which has resulted in a meaningful reduction in DRAM and NAND wafer capacity. Impact of China Cyberspace Administration Decision On March 31, 2023, China’s Cyberspace Administration (the “CAC”) notified us that it was conducting a cybersecurity review of our products sold in China. On May 21, 2023, we received notice that the CAC had concluded its review and decided that our products presented a cybersecurity risk. As such, the CAC determined that critical information infrastructure operators in China may not purchase Micron products. The CAC decision has impacted our business, particularly in the domestic data center and networking markets in China, and we have been working to mitigate that impact. Our goal is to retain our worldwide DRAM and NAND market share. 28 Table of Contents Results of Operations Consolidated Results Second Quarter First Quarter Second Quarter Six months ended 2024 2024 2023 2024 2023 Revenue $ 5,824 100 % $ 4,726 100 % $ 3,693 100 % $ 10,550 100 % $ 7,778 100 % Cost of goods sold 4,745 81 % 4,761 101 % 4,899 133 % 9,506 90 % 8,091 104 % Gross margin 1,079 19 % (35) (1) % (1,206) (33) % 1,044 10 % (313) (4) % Research and development 832 14 % 845 18 % 788 21 % 1,677 16 % 1,637 21 % Selling, general, and administrative 280 5 % 263 6 % 231 6 % 543 5 % 482 6 % Restructure and asset impairments — — % — — % 86 2 % — — % 99 1 % Other operating (income) expense, net (224) (4) % (15) — % (8) — % (239) (2) % (19) — % Operating income (loss) 191 3 % (1,128) (24) % (2,303) (62) % (937) (9) % (2,512) (32) % Interest income (expense), net (14) — % — — % 30 1 % (14) — % 67 1 % Other non-operating income (expense), net (7) — % (27) (1) % 2 — % (34) — % (2) — % Income tax (provision) benefit 622 11 % (73) (2) % (54) (1) % 549 5 % (62) (1) % Equity in net income (loss) of equity method investees 1 — % (6) — % 13 — % (5) — % 2 — % Net income (loss) $ 793 14 % $ (1,234) (26) % $ (2,312) (63) % $ (441) (4) % $ (2,507) (32) % Total Revenue: Total revenue for the second quarter and first six months of 2024 was impacted by the factors described in the section titled “Industry Conditions” above. These conditions drove significant quarterly declines in average selling prices throughout 2023 and a subsequent recovery of average selling prices in the first two quarters of 2024. Total revenue for the second quarter of 2024 increased 23% as compared to the first quarter of 2024 due to increases in sales of both DRAM and NAND products. • Sales of DRAM products in the second quarter of 2024 increased 21% as compared to the first quarter of 2024 primarily due to increases in average selling prices in the high-teens percentage range and a low-single-digit percent range increase in bit shipments. • Sales of NAND products in the second quarter of 2024 increased 27% as compared to the first quarter of 2024 primarily due to a low-30% range increase in average selling prices, partially offset by a low-single-digit percent range decrease in bit shipments. Total revenue for the second quarter of 2024 increased 58% as compared to the second quarter of 2023 due to increases in sales of both DRAM and NAND products. • Sales of DRAM products in the second quarter of 2024 increased 53% as compared to the second quarter of 2023 primarily due to a high-50% range increase in bit shipments. • Sales of NAND products in the second quarter of 2024 increased 77% as compared to the second quarter of 2023 primarily due to a low-60% range increase in bit shipments and an approximate 10% increase in average selling prices. 29 | 2024 Q2 10-Q Table of Contents Total revenue for the first six months of 2024 increased 36% as compared to the first six months of 2023 due to increases in both DRAM and NAND sales. • Sales of DRAM products in the first six months of 2024 increased 37% as compared to the first six months of 2023 primarily due to a high-60% range increase in bit shipments, partially offset by a high-teens percentage range decline in average selling prices. • Sales of NAND products in the first six months of 2024 increased 41% as compared to the first six months of 2023 primarily due to a high-60% range increase in bit shipments, partially offset by a high-teens percentage range decline in average selling prices. Consolidated Gross Margin : Our consolidated gross margin has been impacted by the factors described in the section titled “Industry Conditions” above. Our consolidated gross margin percentage improved to 19% for the second quarter of 2024 from negative 1% for the first quarter of 2024, as a result of improvements in margins for both DRAM and NAND products, primarily due to increases in average selling prices and manufacturing cost reductions. Our consolidated gross margin percentage improved to 19% for the second quarter of 2024 from negative 33% for the second quarter of 2023 primarily due to increases in average selling prices for NAND, the effects of charges to write down inventories to their net realizable value (“NRV”) in 2023, and the sale of previously written down inventories (see “Inventory NRV write-downs” below). Our consolidated gross margin percentage improved to 10% for the first six months of 2024 from negative 4% for the first six months of 2023 primarily due to cost reductions resulting from the effects of NRV write-downs as presented in the table below, partially offset by declines in average selling prices for both DRAM and NAND. Inventory NRV write-downs: Our consolidated gross margin was impacted by charges in the second and third quarters of 2023 to write inventories down to their estimated NRV as a result of declines in average selling prices for both DRAM and NAND. As charges to write down inventories are recorded in advance of when inventories are sold, costs of goods sold in subsequent periods are lower than they otherwise would be. The impact of inventory NRV write-downs for each period reflects (1) inventory write-downs in that period, offset by (2) lower costs in that period on the sale of inventory written down in prior periods. The impacts of inventory NRV write-downs are summarized below: Second Quarter First Quarter Second Quarter Six months ended 2024 2024 2023 2024 2023 Provision to write down inventory to NRV $ — $ — $ (1,430) $ — $ (1,430) Lower costs from sale of inventory written down in prior periods 382 605 — 987 — $ 382 $ 605 $ (1,430) $ 987 $ (1,430) Revenue by Business Unit Second Quarter First Quarter Second Quarter Six months ended 2024 2024 2023 2024 2023 CNBU $ 2,185 38 % $ 1,737 37 % $ 1,375 37 % $ 3,922 37 % $ 3,121 40 % MBU 1,598 27 % 1,293 27 % 945 26 % 2,891 27 % 1,600 21 % EBU 1,111 19 % 1,037 22 % 865 23 % 2,148 20 % 1,865 24 % SBU 905 16 % 653 14 % 507 14 % 1,558 15 % 1,187 15 % All Other 25 — % 6 — % 1 — % 31 — % 5 — % $ 5,824 $ 4,726 $ 3,693 $ 10,550 $ 7,778 Percentages of total revenue may not total 100% due to rounding. 30 Table of Contents Changes in revenue for each business unit for the second quarter of 2024 as compared to the first quarter of 2024 were as follows: • CNBU revenue increased 26% primarily due to increases in DRAM average selling prices and bit shipments driven by improving demand in cloud and data center end markets. • MBU revenue increased 24% primarily due to increases in average selling prices for both mobile DRAM and NAND, partially offset by decreases in bit shipments. • EBU revenue increased 7% primarily due to increases in bit shipments driven by solid demand for leading-edge products in industrial markets. • SBU revenue increased 39% primarily due to increases in NAND average selling prices and bit shipments driven by strong demand across markets. Changes in revenue for each business unit for the second quarter and first six months of 2024 as compared to the corresponding periods of 2023 were as follows: • CNBU revenue increased 59% and 26%, respectively, primarily due to increases in bit shipments, partially offset by declines in average selling prices. • MBU revenue increased 69% and 81%, respectively, primarily due to increases in bit shipments for both DRAM and NAND. MBU average selling prices increased for the second quarter of 2024 as compared to the second quarter of 2023 and decreased slightly for the first six months of 2024 as compared to the first six months of 2023. • EBU revenue increased 28% and 15%, respectively, primarily due to increases in bit shipments, partially offset by declines in average selling prices. • SBU revenue increased 79% and 31%, respectively, primarily due to increases in bit shipments. SBU average selling prices increased for the second quarter of 2024 as compared to the second quarter of 2023 and decreased for the first six months of 2024 as compared to the first six months of 2023.

For the second quarter of 2024 as compared to the first quarter of 2024, CNBU, MBU, and SBU operating income (loss) improved primarily due to increases in average selling prices as a result of improving conditions across most markets. Manufacturing cost reductions in the second quarter of 2024 also contributed to increases in operating income (loss). For EBU, operating income (loss) for the second quarter of 2024 deteriorated from the first quarter of 2024 primarily due to declines in average selling prices. For the second quarter of 2024 as compared to the second quarter of 2023, MBU and SBU operating income (loss) improved primarily due to increases in average selling prices as a result of improving conditions across most markets in 2024. For CNBU, operating income (loss) for the second quarter of 2024 improved from the second quarter of 2023 primarily due to increases in bits sold and manufacturing cost reductions, partially offset by lower average selling prices that had not fully recovered from prior declines. For EBU, operating income (loss) for the second quarter of 2024 deteriorated from the second quarter of 2023 primarily due to declines in average selling prices in 2023, which had not yet fully recovered. 31 | 2024 Q2 10-Q Table of Contents For the first six months of 2024 as compared to the first six months of 2023, operating income (loss) deteriorated for all business units due to lower average selling prices, which had not fully recovered from the steep decline in market conditions across memory and storage markets that occurred throughout 2023. Manufacturing cost reductions and increases in DRAM bit shipments partially offset the adverse effects of pricing on operating margins. Operating Expenses and Other Research and Development: R&D expenses vary primarily with the number of development and pre-qualification wafers processed, the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development, and personnel costs. Because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products, we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing. Development of a product is deemed complete when it is qualified through internal reviews and tests for performance and reliability. R&D expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification. R&D expenses for the second quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2024 were relatively unchanged as lower volumes of development and prequalification wafers were offset by increases in employee compensation. R&D expenses for the second quarter and first six months of 2024 increased 6% and 2%, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods of 2023, primarily due to an increase in employee compensation, partially offset by lower volumes of development and prequalification wafers. Selling, General, and Administrative: SG&A expenses for the second quarter of 2024 increased 6% as compared to the first quarter of 2024 primarily due to an increase in employee compensation. SG&A expenses for the second quarter and first six months of 2024 increased 21% and 13%, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods of 2023, primarily due to an increase in employee compensation. Restructure and Asset Impairments: See “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Restructure and Asset Impairments”. Other Operating (Income) Expense, Net: See “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Other Operating (Income) Expense, Net”. Interest (Income) Expense, Net: Interest income (expense) was not significant for the second quarter of 2024. Interest income (expense) deteriorated for the second quarter and first six months of 2024 as compared to the corresponding periods of 2023 primarily due to increases in interest expense as a result of higher debt balances and interest rates, partially offset by increases in interest income due to higher interest rates on our cash and investments. Income Taxes: Our income tax (provision) benefit consisted of the following: Second Quarter First Quarter Second Quarter Six months ended 2024 2024 2023 2024 2023 Income (loss) before taxes $ 170 $ (1,155) $ (2,271) $ (985) $ (2,447) Income tax (provision) benefit 622 (73) (54) 549 (62) Effective tax rate (365.9) % (6.3) % (2.4) % 55.7 % (2.5) % In the first quarter of 2024, our tax expense was based on actual results for jurisdictions where small changes in our projected pre-tax income would have caused significant changes in the estimated annual effective tax rate. With our improved fiscal 2024 outlook, we can now estimate a more reliable annual effective tax rate and have reverted to a global annual effective tax rate method for all jurisdictions. Applying this updated rate to our year-to-date earnings resulted in the tax benefit recognized in the second quarter of 2024. The change in our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2024 as compared to the first quarter of 2024 was primarily due to the use of the estimated annual effective tax rate for the quarter. The change in our effective tax rate for the first six months of 2024 as compared to the first six months of 2023 was primarily due to changes in levels of profitability and the geographic mix of earnings. 32 Table of Contents We operate in a number of jurisdictions outside the United States, including Singapore, where we have tax incentive arrangements. These incentives expire, in whole or in part, at various dates through 2034 and are conditional, in part, upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds. As a result of the low level of profitability and the geographical mix of income, the benefit from tax incentive arrangements was not material for the periods presented. Various tax reforms are being considered in multiple jurisdictions that, if enacted, contain provisions that could materially impact our tax expense. We continue to monitor the potential impact of these various tax reform proposals to our overall global effective tax rate and financial statements. Other: Further information can be found in “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Equity Plans”. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and financing obtained from capital markets and financial institutions. Cash generated from operations is highly dependent on selling prices for our products, which can vary significantly from period to period. Cash and marketable investments totaled $9.63 billion as of February 29, 2024, and $10.44 billion as of August 31, 2023. Our cash and investments consist primarily of bank deposits, money market funds, and liquid investment-grade, fixed-income securities, which are diversified among industries and individual issuers. To mitigate credit risk, we invest through high-credit-quality financial institutions and by policy generally limit the concentration of credit exposure by restricting the amount of investments with any single obligor. As of February 29, 2024, $1.98 billion of our cash and marketable investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries. We continuously evaluate alternatives for efficiently funding our capital expenditures and ongoing operations. From time to time, we expect to engage in a variety of financing transactions for such purposes as well as to refinance our existing indebtedness, including the issuance of securities. As of February 29, 2024, $2.50 billion was available to draw under our Revolving Credit Facility. Funding of certain significant capital projects is also dependent on the receipt of government incentives, which are subject to conditions and may not be obtained. To develop new product and process technology, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality, we must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies, facilities and equipment, and R&D. We estimate capital expenditures in 2024 for property, plant, and equipment, net of proceeds from government incentives, to be in the range of $7.5 billion to $8.0 billion. Actual amounts for 2024 will vary depending on market conditions and may vary from quarter to quarter due to the timing of expenditures. As of February 29, 2024, we had purchase obligations of approximately $1.01 billion for the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment, of which approximately $938 million is expected to be paid within one year. For a description of other contractual obligations, such as leases and debt, see “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Leases,” and “ – Debt.” To support expected memory demand in the second half of the decade, we will need to add new DRAM wafer capacity. Following the enactment of the CHIPS Act in 2022, we announced plans to invest in two leading-edge memory manufacturing fabs in the United States, contingent on CHIPS Act support through grants and investment tax credits. As part of this plan, in September 2022, we broke ground on a leading-edge memory manufacturing fab in Boise, Idaho. Construction of the fab began in October 2023 with DRAM production targeted to start in calendar 2025 and first output in early calendar 2026. In addition, in October 2022, we announced plans to build a second leading-edge DRAM manufacturing fab in Clay, New York. We expect construction to begin in calendar 2024, with production anticipated to ramp in the latter half of the decade. We expect these new fabs to be key to meeting our requirements for additional wafer capacity starting in the second half of the decade and beyond, in line with industry demand trends. On August 21, 2023, we announced that two of our subsidiaries had each submitted full applications on August 18, 2023 for federal funding in the form of grants under the CHIPS Act for both of these projects. We are also advancing our global back-end assembly and test network in order to support our product portfolio and extend our ability to deliver on global customer demand in the future. We intend to make investments at our 33 | 2024 Q2 10-Q Table of Contents backend facility in Xi’an, China, including a new building to provide space to add more product capability, to allow us over time to serve more of the demand from our customers in China from the Xi’an facility. We began construction of a new assembly and test facility in Gujarat, India to address demand in the latter half of this decade. Our Board of Directors has authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to $10 billion of our outstanding common stock through open-market purchases, block trades, privately-negotiated transactions, derivative transactions, and/or pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date, does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, and is subject to market conditions and our ongoing determination of the best use of available cash. Through February 29, 2024, we had repurchased an aggregate of $6.89 billion of the authorized amount. See “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Equity.” On March 20, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.115 per share, payable in cash on April 16, 2024, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on April 1, 2024. The declaration and payment of any future cash dividends are at the discretion and subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors' decisions regarding the amount and payment of dividends will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions, debt service obligations, contractual restrictions, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. We expect that our cash and investments, cash flows from operations, and available financing will be sufficient to meet our requirements at least through the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Cash Flows Six months ended 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,620 $ 1,286 Net cash provided by (used for) investing activities (2,709) (4,181) Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities (458) 4,434 Effect of changes in currency exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash (8) 9 Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ (555) $ 1,548 Operating Activities: Cash provided by operating activities reflects net income (loss) adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation expense, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, and inventory write-downs, and the effects of changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in cash provided by operating activities for the first six months of 2024 as compared to the first six months of 2023 was primarily due to a smaller net loss in the current year adjusted for non-cash items and the effect of an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and an increase in other current liabilities largely due to approximately $600 million of customer prepayments to secure product supply, partially offset by an increase in receivables and an increase in other current assets primarily due to the second quarter 2024 income tax benefit. Investing Activities: For the first six months of 2024, net cash used for investing activities consisted primarily of $3.18 billion of expenditures for property, plant, and equipment; contributions of $234 million received from government incentives to offset capital expenditures; partially offset by $261 million of net inflows from maturities, sales, and purchases of available-for-sale securities. For the first six months of 2023, net cash used for investing activities consisted primarily of $4.65 billion of expenditures for property, plant, and equipment, partially offset by $480 million of net inflows from maturities, sales, and purchases of available-for-sale securities. Financing Activities: For the first six months of 2024, net cash used for financing activities consisted primarily of $1.10 billion of repayments of debt, which included the prepayment of the 2024 Term Loan A and a portion of the 2025 Term Loan A borrowings, $256 million for payments of dividends to shareholders, and $82 million of payments on equipment purchase contracts, partially offset by approximately $1.00 billion of proceeds from the issuance of the 2031 Notes. See “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Debt.” 34 Table of Contents For the first six months of 2023, net cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of $3.20 billion of proceeds from our 2025, 2026, and 2027 Term Loan A borrowings, $1.27 billion from the issuance of the 2029 B Notes, and $749 million from the issuance of the 2033 A Notes. Cash used for financing activities included $425 million for the acquisition of 8.6 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase authorization, $252 million of cash payments of dividends to shareholders, and $76 million of payments on equipment purchase contracts.

SEC regulations require disclosure of certain proceedings related to environmental matters unless we reasonably believe that the related monetary sanctions, if any, will be less than a specified threshold. We use a threshold of $1 million for this purpose. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, this section discusses important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by us. The order of presentation is not necessarily indicative of the level of risk that each factor poses to us. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or stock price. Our operations could also be affected by other factors that are presently unknown to us or not considered significant. Risk Factor Summary Risks Related to Our Business, Operations, and Industry • volatility in average selling prices of our products; • a range of factors that may adversely affect our gross margins; • our international operations, including geopolitical risks; • the highly competitive nature of our industry; • our ability to develop and produce new and competitive memory and storage technologies and products; • realizing expected returns from capacity expansions; • achieving or maintaining certain outcomes or compliance with other obligations associated with incentives from various governments; • availability and quality of materials, supplies, and capital equipment and dependency on third-party service providers; • a downturn in regional or worldwide economies; • disruptions to our manufacturing process from operational issues, natural disasters, or other events; • dependency on a select number of key customers, including international customers; • products that fail to meet specifications, are defective, or are incompatible with end uses; • breaches of our security systems or products, or those of our customers, suppliers, or business partners; • attracting, retaining, and motivating highly skilled employees; • responsible sourcing requirements and related regulations; • environmental, social, and governance considerations; • acquisitions and/or alliances; and • restructure plans may not realize expected savings or other benefits. Risks Related to Intellectual Property and Litigation • protecting our intellectual property and retaining key employees who are knowledgeable of and develop our intellectual property; • legal proceedings and claims; and • claims that our products or manufacturing processes infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others or failure to obtain or renew license agreements covering such intellectual property. Risks Related to Laws and Regulations • impacts of government actions and compliance with tariffs, trade restrictions, and/or trade regulations; • tax expense and tax laws in key jurisdictions; and • compliance with laws, regulations, or industry standards, including environmental considerations. Risks Related to Capitalization and Financial Markets • our ability to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing; • our debt obligations; • changes in foreign currency exchange rates; • counterparty default risk; • volatility in the trading price of our common stock; and • fluctuations in the amount and frequency of our common stock repurchases and payment of cash dividends and resulting impacts. 37 | 2024 Q2 10-Q Table of Contents Risks Related to Our Business, Operations, and Industry Volatility in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory and storage products may adversely affect our business. We have experienced significant volatility in our average selling prices and may continue to experience such volatility in the future. For example, average selling prices for DRAM declined in the high-40s percent range and NAND declined in the low-50s percent range for 2023 as compared to 2022. Since 2017, annual percentage changes in DRAM average selling prices have ranged from plus mid-30s percent range to a minus high-40s percent range. Since 2017, annual percentage changes in NAND average selling prices have ranged from nearly flat to a minus low-50s percent range. In recent periods, average selling prices for our products have been below our manufacturing costs and we may experience such circumstances in the future. Average selling prices for our products that decline faster than our costs have recently had an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and in future periods could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Our gross margins may be adversely affected by a range of factors. Our gross margins are dependent, in part, upon continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes and product designs. Factors that may limit our ability to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to prevent deterioration of or improve gross margins include, but are not limited to: • strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix; • increasing complexity of manufacturing processes; • difficulties in transitioning to smaller line-width process technologies or additional 3D memory layers or NAND cell levels; • process complexity including number of mask layers and fabrication steps; • manufacturing yield; • technological barriers; • changes in process technologies; • new products that may require relatively larger die sizes; • start-up or other costs associated with capacity expansions; • higher costs of goods and services due to inflationary pressures or market conditions; and • higher manufacturing costs per gigabit due to fabrication facility underutilization, lower wafer output, and insufficient volume to run new technology nodes to achieve cost optimization. Many factors may result in a reduction of our output or a delay in ramping production, which could lead to underutilization of our production assets. These factors may include, among others, a weak demand environment, industry oversupply, inventory surpluses, difficulties in ramping emerging technologies, supply chain disruptions, and delays from equipment suppliers. See “Part I. Financial Information – Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Overview – Industry Conditions” for information regarding our recent underutilization charges. A significant portion of our manufacturing costs are fixed and do not vary proportionally with changes in production output. As a result, lower utilization, lower wafer output, and corresponding increases in our per gigabit manufacturing costs have resulted in higher inventory carrying costs, and have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our gross margins, business, results of operations, or financial condition. 38 Table of Contents We have a broad portfolio of products to address our customers’ needs, which span multiple market segments and are subject to rapid technological changes. Our manufacturing costs on a per gigabit basis vary across our portfolio as they are largely influenced by the technology node in which the solution was developed. We strive to balance our demand and supply for each technology node, but the dynamics of our markets and our customers can create periods of imbalance, which can lead us to carry elevated inventory levels. Consequently, we may incur charges in connection with obsolete or excess inventories, or we may not fully recover our costs, which would reduce our gross margins. For example, in 2023, we recorded aggregate charges of $1.83 billion to write down the carrying value of our inventories to their estimated net realizable value. In addition, due to the customized nature of certain products we manufacture, we may be unable to sell certain finished goods inventories to alternative customers or manufacture in-process inventory to different specifications, which may result in excess and obsolescence charges in future periods. In addition, if we are unable to supply products that meet customer design and performance specifications, we may be required to sell such products at lower average selling prices, which may reduce our gross margins. Our gross margins may also be impacted by shifts in product mix, driven by our strategy to optimize our portfolio to best respond to changing market dynamics. Our inability to prevent deterioration of or improve gross margins could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. We face geopolitical and other risks associated with our international operations that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. In addition to our U.S. operations, a substantial portion of our operations are conducted in Taiwan, Singapore, Japan, Malaysia, China, and India, and many of our customers, suppliers, and vendors also operate internationally. In 2023, nearly half of our revenue was from sales to customers who have headquarters located outside the United States, while over 80% of our revenue in 2023 was from products shipped to customer locations outside the United States. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks, including: • restrictions on sales of goods or services to one or more of our significant foreign customers; • export and import duties, changes to import and export regulations, customs regulations and processes, and restrictions on the transfer of funds, including currency controls in China, which could negatively affect the amount and timing of payments from certain of our customers and, as a result, our cash flows; • compliance with U.S. and international laws involving international operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, sanctions and anti-corruption laws, export and import laws, and similar rules and regulations; • theft of intellectual property; • political and economic instability, including instability resulting from domestic and international conflicts; • government actions or civil unrest preventing the flow of products and materials, including delays in shipping and obtaining products and materials, cancellation of orders, or loss or damage of products; • problems with the transportation or delivery of products and materials; • issues arising from cultural or language differences and labor unrest; • longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; • compliance with trade, technical standards, and other laws in a variety of jurisdictions; • contractual and regulatory limitations on the ability to maintain flexibility with staffing levels; • disruptions to manufacturing or R&D activities as a result of actions imposed by foreign governments; • changes in economic policies of foreign governments; • difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and • public health issues. If we or our customers, suppliers, or vendors are impacted by any of these risks, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 39 | 2024 Q2 10-Q Table of Contents Following the May 21, 2023 decision of its cybersecurity review of our products sold in China, the CAC determined that critical information infrastructure operators in China may not purchase Micron products, impacting our revenue with companies headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong, including direct sales as well as indirect sales through distributors. Some revenue with customers headquartered outside of China has also been impacted. Further actions by the Chinese government could impact additional revenue inside or outside China, or our operations in China, or our ability to ship products to our customers, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Political, economic, or other actions may adversely affect our operations in Taiwan. A majority of our DRAM production output in 2023 was from our fabrication facilities in Taiwan and any loss of output could have a material adverse effect on us. Any political, economic, or other actions may also adversely affect our customers and the technology industry supply chain, for which Taiwan is a central hub, and as a result, could have a material adverse impact on us. In addition, the U.S. government has in the past restricted American firms from selling products and software to certain of our customers and may in the future impose similar restrictions on one or more of our significant customers. These restrictions may not prohibit our competitors from selling similar products to our customers, which may result in our loss of sales and market share. Even as such restrictions are lifted, financial or other penalties or continuing export restrictions imposed with respect to our customers could have a continuing negative impact on our future revenue and results of operations, and we may not be able to recover any customers or market share we lose, or make such recoveries at acceptable average selling prices, while complying with such restrictions. The semiconductor memory and storage markets are highly competitive. We face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets from a number of companies, including Kioxia Holdings Corporation; Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.; SK hynix Inc.; and Western Digital Corporation. Our competitors may use aggressive pricing to obtain market share. Some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have a larger market share and greater resources to invest in technology, capitalize on growth opportunities, and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete. Consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage as our competitors may benefit from increased manufacturing scale and a stronger product portfolio. We operate in different jurisdictions than our competitors and may be impacted by unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. In addition, some governments may provide, or have provided and may continue to provide, significant assistance, financial or otherwise, to some of our competitors or to new entrants and may intervene in support of national industries and/or competitors. In particular, we face the threat of increasing competition as a result of significant investment in the semiconductor industry by the Chinese government and various state-owned or affiliated entities, in companies such as Yangtze Memory Technologies Co., Ltd. (“YMTC”) and ChangXin Memory Technologies, Inc. (“CXMT”). In addition, the CAC’s decision that critical information infrastructure operators in China may not purchase Micron products had an impact on our ability to compete effectively in China and elsewhere. We and our competitors generally seek to increase supply to address growing market demands, improve yields, and reduce die size, which could result in significant increases in worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices. Increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage also result from fabrication capacity expansions, either by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization, or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory and storage production. Our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply. We, and some of our competitors, have plans to ramp, or are constructing or ramping, production at new fabrication facilities. Increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage, if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand, could lead to declines in average selling prices for our products and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. If competitors are more successful at developing or implementing new product or process technology, their products could have cost or performance advantages. The competitive nature of our industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 40 Table of Contents Our future success depends on our ability to develop and produce new and competitive memory and storage technologies and products. Our key semiconductor memory and storage technologies face technological barriers to continue to meet long-term customer needs. These barriers include potential limitations on stacking additional 3D memory layers, increasing bits per cell (i.e., cell levels), meeting higher density requirements, developing advanced packaging solutions, improving power consumption and reliability, and delivering advanced features and higher performance. We may face technological barriers to continue to shrink our products at our current or historical rate, which has generally reduced per gigabit cost. We have invested and expect to continue to invest in R&D for new and existing products and process technologies, such as EUV lithography, to continue to deliver advanced product requirements. Such new technologies can add complexity and risk to our schedule and may affect our costs and production output. We may be unable to recover our investment in R&D or otherwise realize the economic benefits of reducing die size or increasing memory and storage densities. Our competitors are working to develop new memory and storage technologies that may offer performance and/or cost advantages to existing technologies and render existing technologies obsolete. Accordingly, our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce viable and competitive new memory and storage technologies. We are developing new products, including system-level memory and storage products and solutions, which complement our traditional products or leverage their underlying design or process technology. We have invested and expect to continue to invest in new semiconductor product and system-level solution development. We are increasingly differentiating our products and solutions to meet the specific demands of our customers, which increases our reliance on our customers’ ability to accurately forecast the needs and preferences of their customers. As a result, our product demand forecasts may be impacted significantly by the strategic actions of our customers. In addition, our ability to successfully introduce new products often requires us to make product specification decisions multiple years in advance of when new products enter the market. It is important that we deliver products in a timely manner with increasingly advanced performance characteristics at the time our customers are designing and evaluating samples for their products. If we do not meet their product design schedules, our customers may exclude us from further consideration as a supplier for those products. The process to develop new products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality, performance, and reliability, often well in advance of a planned ramp of production, in order to secure design wins with our customers. Many factors may negatively impact our ability to meet anticipated timelines and/or expected or required quality standards with respect to the development of certain of our products. In addition, some of our components have long lead-times, requiring us to place orders up to a year in advance of anticipated demand. Such long lead-times increase the risk of excess inventory or loss of sales in the event our forecasts vary substantially from actual demand. There can be no assurance of the following: • we will be successful in developing competitive new semiconductor memory and storage technologies and products; • we will be able to cost-effectively manufacture new products; • we will be able to successfully market these technologies; • margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts; • we will be able to establish or maintain key relationships with customers, or that we will not be prohibited from working with certain customers, for specific chip set or design requirements; • we will accurately predict and design products that meet our customers' specifications; or • we will be able to introduce new products into the market and qualify them with our customers on a timely basis. Unsuccessful efforts to develop new memory and storage technologies and products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 41 | 2024 Q2 10-Q Table of Contents We may not be able to achieve expected returns from capacity expansions. We have announced our intent to expand our production capacity and/or make capital investments in the United States and in other regions where we operate. These expansions involve several risks including the following: • capital expenditure requirements for capacity expansions during periods of relatively low free cash flow generation, resulting from challenging memory and storage industry conditions; • availability of necessary funding, which may include external sources; • ability to realize expected grants, investment tax credits, and other government incentives, including through the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 (“CHIPS Act”) and other national, international, state, and local grants; • potential changes in laws or provisions of grants, investment tax credits, and other government incentives; • potential restrictions on expanding in certain geographies; • availability of equipment and construction materials; • ability to complete construction as scheduled and within budget; • availability of the necessary workforce; • ability to timely ramp production in a cost-effective manner; • increases to our cost structure until new production is ramped to adequate scale; and • sufficient customer demand to utilize our increased capacity. We invest our capital in areas that we believe best align with our business strategy and optimize future returns. Investments in capital expenditures may not generate expected returns or cash flows. Significant judgment is required to determine which capital investments will result in optimal returns, and we could invest in projects that are ultimately less profitable than those projects we do not select. Delays in completion and ramping of new production facilities, or failure to optimize our investment choices, could significantly impact our ability to realize expected returns on our capital expenditures. Any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Our incentives from various governments are conditional upon achieving or maintaining certain outcomes or compliance with other obligations and are subject to reduction, termination, clawback, or could impose certain limitations on our business. We have received, and may in the future continue to receive, benefits and incentives from national, state, and local governments in various regions of the world designed to encourage us to establish, maintain, or increase investment, workforce, research and development, or production in those regions. These incentives may take various forms, including grants, subsidies, loans, and tax arrangements, and typically require us to achieve or maintain certain levels of investment, capital spending, employment, technology deployment or development milestones, or research and development activities to qualify for such incentives or could restrict us from undertaking certain activities. We may be unable to obtain sufficient future incentives to continue to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and operating costs, without which our cost structure may be adversely impacted and planned capital expenditures and research and development expenditures may be affected. We also cannot guarantee that we will successfully achieve and maintain outcomes or be able to comply with other obligations required to qualify for these incentives or that the granting agencies will provide or continue to provide such funding. These incentive arrangements typically provide the granting agencies with rights to audit our compliance with their terms and obligations. Such audits could result in modifications to, or termination of, the applicable incentive program. The incentives we receive could be subject to reduction, termination, or clawback, and any decrease or clawback of government incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 42 Table of Contents Our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be adversely affected by the availability and quality of materials, supplies, and capital equipment, or dependency on third-party service providers. Our supply chain and operations are dependent on the availability of materials that meet exacting standards and the use of third parties to provide us with components and services. We generally have multiple sources of supply for our materials and services. However, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain materials, components, and services that meet our standards and, in some cases, materials, components, or services are provided by a single or sole source, and we may be unable to qualify new suppliers on a timely basis. The availability of materials or components such as chemicals, silicon wafers, gases, photoresist, controllers, substrates, lead frames, printed circuit boards, targets, and reticle glass blanks is impacted by various factors. These factors could include a shortage of raw materials or a disruption in the processing or purification of those raw materials into finished goods. Shortages or increases in lead times have occurred in the past, are currently occurring with respect to some materials and components, and may occur from time to time in the future. Constraints within our supply chain for certain materials and integrated circuit components could limit our bit shipments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Our manufacturing processes are also dependent on our relationships with third-party manufacturers of controllers, analog integrated circuits, and other components used in some of our products and with outsourced semiconductor foundries, assembly and test providers, contract manufacturers, logistics carriers, and other service providers, including providers of maintenance for our advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment and providers of electricity and other utilities. Although we have certain long-term contracts with some of our suppliers, many of these contracts do not provide for long-term capacity or pricing commitments. To the extent we do not have firm commitments from our third-party suppliers over a specific time period or for any specific capacity, quantity, and/or pricing, our suppliers may allocate capacity to their other customers and capacity and/or materials may not be available when needed or at reasonable prices. Inflationary pressures have increased, and may continue to increase costs for materials, supplies, and services. Regardless of contract structure, large swings in demand may exceed our contracted supply and/or our suppliers’ capacity to meet those demand changes resulting in a shortage of parts, materials, or capacity needed to manufacture our products. In addition, if any of our suppliers were to cease operations or become insolvent, this could impact their ability to provide us with necessary supplies, and we may not be able to obtain the needed supply in a timely way or at all from other providers. Certain materials are primarily available in a limited number of countries, including rare earth elements, minerals, and metals. Trade disputes, geopolitical tensions, economic circumstances, political conditions, or public health issues may limit our ability to obtain such materials. Although these rare earth and other materials are generally available from multiple suppliers, China is the predominant producer of certain of these materials. If China were to restrict or stop exporting these materials, our suppliers’ ability to obtain such supply may be constrained and we may be unable to obtain sufficient quantities, or obtain supply in a timely manner, or at a commercially reasonable cost. Constrained supply of rare earth elements, minerals, and metals may restrict our ability to manufacture certain of our products and make it difficult or impossible to compete with other semiconductor memory and storage manufacturers who are able to obtain sufficient quantities of these materials from China. We and/or our suppliers and service providers could be affected by regional conflicts, civil unrest, labor disruptions, sanctions, tariffs, embargoes, or other trade restrictions, as well as laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change, conflict minerals, responsible sourcing practices, public health crises, or other matters, which could limit the supply of our materials and/or increase the cost. Environmental regulations could limit our ability to procure or use certain chemicals or materials in our operations or products. In addition, disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of materials. Our ability to procure components to repair equipment essential for our manufacturing processes could also be negatively impacted by various restrictions or disruptions in supply chains, among other items. The disruption of our supply of materials, components, or services, or the extension of our lead times could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 43 | 2024 Q2 10-Q Table of Contents Our operations are dependent on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment that enables the transition to lower cost manufacturing processes. For certain key types of equipment, including photolithography tools, we are sometimes dependent on a single supplier. From time to time, we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to suppliers’ limited capacity. Our inability to obtain equipment on a timely basis could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing processes and reduce our costs. Delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production and could increase our overall costs of a ramp. Our inability to obtain advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Our construction projects to expand production and R&D capacity are highly dependent on available sources of labor, materials, equipment, and services. Increasing demand, supply constraints, inflation, and other market conditions could result in increasing shortages and higher costs for these items. Difficulties in obtaining these resources could result in significant delays in completion of our construction projects and cost increases, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Our inability to source materials, supplies, capital equipment, or third-party services could affect our overall production output and our ability to fulfill customer demand. Significant or prolonged shortages of our products could halt customer manufacturing and damage our relationships with these customers. Any damage to our customer relationships as a result of a shortage of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Similarly, if our customers experience disruptions to their supplies, materials, components, or services, or the extension of their lead times, they may reduce, cancel, or alter the timing of their purchases with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Downturns in regional or worldwide economies may harm our business. Downturns in regional or worldwide economies, due to inflation, geopolitics, major central bank policy actions including interest rate increases, public health crises, or other factors, have harmed our business in the past and current and future downturns could also adversely affect our business. Adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that incorporate our products, such as personal computers, smartphones, automobiles, and servers. Reduced demand for these or other products could result in significant decreases in our average selling prices and product sales. In addition, to the extent our customers or distributors have elevated inventory levels or are impacted by a deterioration in credit markets, we may experience a decrease in short-term and/or long-term demand resulting in industry oversupply and declines in pricing for our products. A deterioration of conditions in regional or worldwide credit markets could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures. In addition, we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties. Difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivable due to credit defaults. As a result, downturns in regional or worldwide economies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. If our manufacturing process is disrupted by operational issues, natural disasters, or other events, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. We and our subcontractors manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance. Difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs. We and our subcontractors maintain operations and continuously implement new product and process technology at manufacturing facilities, which are widely dispersed in multiple locations in several countries including the United States, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, Malaysia, and China. As a result of the necessary interdependence within our network of manufacturing facilities, an operational disruption at one of our or a subcontractor’s facilities may have a disproportionate impact on our ability to produce many of our products. 44 Table of Contents From time to time, there have been disruptions in our manufacturing operations as a result of power outages, improperly functioning equipment, disruptions in supply of raw materials or components, or equipment failures. We have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences and possible climate changes, such as severe and variable weather and geological events resulting in increased costs, or disruptions to our manufacturing operations or those of our suppliers or customers. In addition, climate change may pose physical risks to our manufacturing facilities or our suppliers’ facilities, including increased extreme weather events that could result in supply delays or disruptions. Other events, including political or public health crises, such as an outbreak of contagious diseases, may also affect our production capabilities or that of our suppliers, including as a result of quarantines, closures of production facilities, lack of supplies, or delays caused by restrictions on travel or shipping. Events of the types noted above have occurred from time to time and may occur in the future. As a result, in addition to disruptions to operations, our insurance premiums may increase or we may not be able to fully recover any sustained losses through insurance. If production is disrupted for any reason, manufacturing yields may be adversely affected, or we may be unable to meet our customers’ requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers. This could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs, loss of revenue, or damage to customer relationships, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. A significant portion of our revenue is concentrated with a select number of customers. Approximately one-half of our total revenue comes from our top ten customers. A disruption in our relationship with any of these customers could adversely affect our business. We could experience fluctuations in our customer base or the mix of revenue by customer as markets and strategies evolve. Our customers’ demand for our products may fluctuate due to factors beyond our control. In addition, any consolidation of our customers could reduce the number of customers to whom our products may be sold. Our inability to meet our customers’ requirements or to qualify our products with them could adversely impact our revenue. A meaningful change in the inventory strategy of our customers could impact our industry bit demand growth outlook. The loss of, or restrictions on our ability to sell to, one or more of our major customers, or any significant reduction in orders from, or a shift in product mix by, customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Increases in sales of system solutions may increase our dependency upon specific customers and our costs to develop, qualify, and manufacture our system solutions. Our development of system-level memory and storage products is dependent, in part, upon successfully identifying and meeting our customers’ specifications for those products. Developing and manufacturing system-level products with specifications unique to a customer increases our reliance upon that customer for purchasing our products at sufficient volumes and prices in a timely manner. Even if our products meet customer specifications, our sales of system-level solutions are dependent upon our customers choosing our products over those of our competitors and purchasing our products at sufficient volumes and prices. Our competitors’ products may be less costly, provide better performance, or include additional features when compared to our products. Our long-term ability to sell system-level memory and storage products is reliant upon our customers’ ability to create, market, and sell their products containing our system-level solutions at sufficient volumes and prices in a timely manner. If we fail to successfully develop and market system-level products, our business, results of operations, or financial condition may be materially adversely affected. Manufacturing system-level solutions, such as SSDs, managed NAND, and HBM, typically results in higher per-unit manufacturing costs as compared to other products. Even if we are successful in selling system-level solutions to our customers in sufficient volume, we may be unable to generate sufficient profit if our per-unit manufacturing costs are not offset by higher per-unit selling prices. Manufacturing system-level solutions to customer specifications requires a longer development cycle, as compared to discrete products, to design, test, and qualify, which may increase our costs. Some of our system solutions are increasingly dependent on sophisticated firmware that may require significant customization to meet customer specifications, which increases our costs and time to market. Additionally, we may need to update our controller and hardware design as well as our firmware or develop new firmware as a result of new product introductions or changes in customer specifications and/or industry standards, which increases our costs. System complexities and extended warranties for system-level products could also increase our warranty costs. Our failure to cost-effectively manufacture system-level solutions and/or controller, hardware design, and firmware in a timely manner may result in reduced demand for our system-level products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 45 | 2024 Q2 10-Q Table of Contents Products that fail to meet specifications, are defective, or are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us. Products that do not meet specifications or that contain, or are perceived by our customers to contain, defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. From time to time, we experience problems with nonconforming, defective, or incompatible products after we have shipped such products. In recent periods, we have further diversified and expanded our product offerings, which could potentially increase the chance that one or more of our products could fail to meet specifications in a particular application. Our products and solutions may be deemed fully or partially responsible for functionality in our customers’ products and may result in sharing or shifting of product or financial liability from our customers to us for costs incurred by the end user as a result of our customers’ products failing to perform as specified. In addition, if our products and solutions perform critical functions in our customers’ products or are used in high-risk consumer end products, such as autonomous driver assistance programs, home and enterprise security, smoke and noxious gas detectors, medical monitoring equipment, or wearables for child and elderly safety, our potential liability may increase. We could be adversely affected in several ways, including the following: • we may be required or agree to compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible products and to replace products; • we could incur a decrease in revenue or adjustment to pricing commensurate with the reimbursement of such costs or alleged damages; and • we may encounter adverse publicity, which could cause a decrease in sales of our products or harm our reputation or relationships with existing or potential customers. Any of the foregoing items could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Breaches of our security systems or products, or those of our customers, suppliers, or business partners, could expose us to losses. We maintain a system of controls over the physical security of our facilities. We also manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations. In addition, we process, store, and transmit large amounts of data relating to our customers and employees, including sensitive personal information. Unauthorized persons, employees, former employees, nation states, or other parties may gain access to our facilities or technology infrastructure and systems through fraudulent means to steal trade secrets or other proprietary information, compromise confidential information, create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. This risk is exacerbated as competitors for talent, particularly engineering talent, attempt to hire our employees. Through cyberattacks on technology infrastructure and systems, unauthorized parties may obtain access to computer systems, networks, and data, including cloud-based platforms. The technology infrastructure and systems of our suppliers, vendors, service providers, cloud solution providers, and partners have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, such attacks, which could impact our operations. Cyberattacks can include ransomware, computer denial-of-service attacks, worms, supply chain attacks, social engineering, open source vulnerabilities, and other malicious software programs or other attacks, including those using techniques that change frequently or may be disguised or difficult to detect, or designed to remain dormant until a triggering event, impersonation of authorized users, and efforts to discover and exploit any design flaws, “bugs,” security vulnerabilities, as well as intentional or unintentional acts by employees or other insiders with access privileges. Additionally, some actors are using artificial intelligence technology to launch more automated, targeted, and coordinated attacks. Globally, cyberattacks are increasing in number and the attackers are increasingly organized and well-financed, or supported by state actors, and are developing increasingly sophisticated systems to not only attack, but also to evade detection. In addition, geopolitical tensions or conflicts may create a heightened risk of cyberattacks. Breaches of our physical security, attacks on our technology infrastructure and systems, or breaches or attacks on our customers, suppliers, or business partners who have confidential or sensitive information regarding us and our customers and suppliers, could result in significant losses and damage our reputation with customers and suppliers and may expose us to litigation if the confidential information of our customers, suppliers, or employees is compromised. 46 Table of Contents Our products are also targets for cyberattacks, including those products utilized in cloud-based environments. While some of our products contain encryption or security algorithms designed to protect third-party content or user-generated data stored on our products, these products could still be hacked or the encryption schemes could be compromised, breached, or circumvented by motivated and sophisticated attackers. Further, our products contain sophisticated hardware and firmware and applications that may contain security vulnerabilities or defects in design or manufacture, including “bugs” and other problems that could interfere with the intended operation of our products. To the extent our products are hacked, or the encryption schemes are compromised or breached, this could harm our business by requiring us to employ additional resources to fix the errors or defects, exposing us to litigation, claims, and harm to our reputation. Additionally, we cannot be certain that any applicable insurance coverage we maintain will be adequate or otherwise protect us with respect to claims, expenses, fines, penalties, business loss, data loss, litigation, regulatory actions, or other impacts arising from security breaches or incidents, or that such coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or at all. Any of the foregoing security risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. We must attract, retain, and motivate highly skilled employees. To remain competitive, we must attract, retain, and motivate executives and a highly skilled, diverse workforce, as well as effectively manage succession for key roles. Competition for experienced employees in our industry can be intense. Hiring and retaining qualified executives and other skilled talent is critical to our business. If our total compensation programs, employment benefits, and workplace culture are not viewed as competitive and inclusive, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees could be compromised. At times, we experience higher levels of attrition, increasing compensation costs, and more intense competition for talent across our industry. To the extent we experience significant attrition and are unable to timely replace employees, we could experience a loss of critical skills and reduced employee morale, potentially resulting in business disruptions or increased expenses to address any disruptions. Additionally, changes to immigration policies in the countries in which we operate, as well as restrictions on travel due to public health crises or other causes, may limit our ability to hire and/or retain talent in, or transfer talent to, specific locations. Our inability to attract, retain, and motivate executives and other employees or effectively manage succession of key roles may inhibit our ability to maintain or expand our business operations. Compliance with responsible sourcing requirements and any related regulations could increase our operating costs, or limit the supply and increase the cost of certain materials, supplies, and services, and if we fail to comply, customers may reduce purchases from us or disqualify us as a supplier. We and many of our customers have adopted responsible sourcing programs that require us to meet certain environmental, social, and governance criteria, and to periodically report on our performance against these requirements, including that we source the materials, supplies, and services we use and incorporate into the products we sell as prescribed by these programs. Many customer programs require us to remove a supplier within a prescribed period if such supplier ceases to comply with prescribed criteria, and our supply chain may at any time contain suppliers at risk of being removed due to non-compliance with responsible sourcing requirements. Some of our customers may elect to disqualify us as a supplier (resulting in a permanent or temporary loss of sales to such customer) or reduce purchases from us if we are unable to verify that our performance or products (including the underlying supply chain) meet the specifications of our customers’ responsible sourcing programs on a continuous basis. Meeting responsible sourcing requirements may increase operating requirements and costs or limit the sourcing and availability of some of the materials, supplies, and services we use, particularly when the availability of such materials, supplies, and services is concentrated to a limited number of suppliers. From time to time, we remove suppliers or require our suppliers to remove suppliers from their supply chains based on our responsible sourcing requirements or customer requirements, and we or our suppliers may be unable to replace such removed suppliers in a timely or cost-effective manner. Any inability to replace removed suppliers in a timely or cost effective manner may affect our ability and/or the cost to obtain sufficient quantities of materials, supplies, and services necessary for the manufacture of our products. Our inability to replace suppliers we have removed in a timely or cost-effective manner or comply with customers’ responsible sourcing requirements or with any related regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 47 | 2024 Q2 10-Q Table of Contents Failure to meet environmental, social, and governance expectations or standards or achieve our related goals could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or stock price. In recent years, there has been an increased focus from stakeholders on environmental, social, and governance matters, including greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related risks, sustainability, renewable energy, water stewardship, waste management, diversity, equality and inclusion, responsible sourcing and supply chain, human rights, and social responsibility. Given our commitment to social and environmental issues as it relates to our business, we actively manage these issues and have established and publicly announced certain goals, commitments, and targets which we may refine or even expand further in the future. These goals, commitments, and targets reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. Achieving these goals may entail significant costs, for example we have entered into several virtual power purchase agreements to obtain renewable energy credits at a cost that will vary based on future prices for electrical power. Evolving stakeholder expectations and our efforts to manage these issues, report on them, and accomplish our goals present numerous operational, regulatory, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks, any of which could have a material adverse impact, including on our reputation and stock price. Such risks and uncertainties include: • reputational harm, including damage to our relationships with customers, suppliers, investors, governments, or other stakeholders; • adverse impacts on our ability to manufacture and sell products and maintain our market share; • the success of our collaborations with third parties; • increased risk of litigation, investigations, or regulatory enforcement action; • unfavorable environmental, social, and governance ratings or investor sentiment; • diversion of resources and increased costs to control, assess, and report on environmental, social, and governance metrics; • our ability to achieve our goals, commitments, and targets within timeframes announced; • increased costs to achieve our goals, commitments, and targets; • unforeseen operational and technological difficulties; • access to and increased cost of capital; and • adverse impacts on our stock price. Any failure, or perceived failure, to meet evolving stakeholder expectations and industry standards or achieve our environmental, social, and governance goals, commitments, and targets could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or stock price. Acquisitions and/or alliances involve numerous risks. Acquisitions and the formation or operation of alliances, such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements, involve numerous risks, including the following: • integrating the operations, technologies, and products of acquired or newly formed entities into our operations; • increasing capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain facilities; • increased debt levels; • the assumption of unknown or underestimated liabilities; • the use of cash to finance a transaction, which may reduce the availability of cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures, R&D expenditures, and other business activities; • diverting management’s attention from daily operations; • managing larger or more complex operations and facilities and employees in separate and diverse geographic areas; • hiring and retaining key employees; • requirements imposed by government authorities in connection with the regulatory review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures or restrictions on the conduct of our business or the acquired business; • underestimating the costs or overestimating the benefits, including product, revenue, cost and other synergies and growth opportunities that we expect to realize, and we may not achieve those benefits; • failure to maintain customer, vendor, and other relationships; 48 Table of Contents • inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company’s internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, compliance programs, and/or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices; and • impairment of acquired intangible assets, goodwill, or other assets as a result of changing business conditions or technological advancements. The global memory and storage industry has experienced consolidation and may continue to consolidate. We engage, from time to time, in discussions regarding potential acquisitions and similar opportunities. To the extent we are successful in completing any such transactions, we could be subject to some or all of the risks described above. Acquisitions of, or alliances with, technology companies are inherently risky and may not be successful and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. We have incurred restructure charges and may incur restructure charges in future periods and may not realize expected savings or other benefits from restructure plans. In 2023, we initiated a restructure plan in response to challenging industry conditions (the “2023 Restructure Plan”). Under the 2023 Restructure Plan, we reduced our headcount by approximately 15% through a combination of voluntary attrition and personnel reductions. The 2023 Restructure Plan was substantially completed in 2023. In addition, we may in the future enter into other restructure initiatives in order to, among other items, streamline our operations, respond to changes in business conditions, our markets, or product offerings, or to centralize certain key functions. We may not realize expected savings or other benefits from our 2023 Restructure Plan or future restructure activities and may incur additional restructure charges or other losses in future periods associated with other initiatives. In connection with any restructure initiatives, we could incur restructure charges, loss of production output, loss of key personnel, disruptions in our operations, and difficulties in the timely delivery of products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Risks Related to Intellectual Property and Litigation We may be unable to protect our intellectual property or retain key employees who are knowledgeable of and develop our intellectual property. We maintain a system of controls over our intellectual property, including U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, licensing arrangements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with employees, consultants, and vendors, and a general system of internal controls. Despite our system of controls over our intellectual property, it may be possible for our current or future competitors to obtain, copy, use, or disclose, illegally or otherwise, our product and process technology or other proprietary information. The laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same degree as do U.S. laws, and our confidentiality, non-disclosure, and non-compete agreements may be unenforceable or difficult and costly to enforce. Additionally, our ability to maintain and develop intellectual property is dependent upon our ability to attract, develop, and retain highly skilled employees. If our competitors or future entrants into our industry are successful in hiring our employees, they may directly benefit from the knowledge these employees gained while they were under our employment, and this may also negatively impact our ability to maintain and develop intellectual property. Our inability to protect our intellectual property or retain key employees who are knowledgeable of and develop our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Legal proceedings and claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. From time to time, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business or otherwise, both domestically and internationally. Such claims include, but are not limited to, allegations of anticompetitive conduct and infringement of intellectual property. See “Part I. Financial Information – Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Contingencies.” 49 | 2024 Q2 10-Q Table of Contents Any claim, with or without merit, could result in significant legal fees that could negatively impact our financial results, disrupt our operations, and require significant attention from our management. We may be associated with and subject to litigation, claims, or arbitration disputes arising from, or as a result of: • our relationships with vendors or customers, supply agreements, or contractual obligations with our subcontractors or business partners; • the actions of our vendors, subcontractors, or business partners; • our indemnification obligations, including obligations to defend our customers against third-party claims asserting infringement of certain intellectual property rights, which may include patents, trademarks, copyrights, or trade secrets; and • the terms of our product warranties or from product liability claims. As we continue to focus on developing system solutions with manufacturers of consumer products, including autonomous driving, augmented reality, and others, we may be exposed to greater potential for personal liability claims against us as a result of consumers’ use of those products. We, our officers, or our directors could also be subject to claims of alleged violations of securities laws. There can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities, and we may elect to self-insure with respect to certain matters. Exposures to various legal proceedings and claims could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend claims, are required to pay damage awards, or enter into settlement agreements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Claims that our products or manufacturing processes infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others, or failure to obtain or renew license agreements covering such intellectual property, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. As is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries, from time to time others have asserted, and may in the future assert, that our products or manufacturing processes infringe upon, misappropriate, misuse, or otherwise violate their intellectual property rights. We are unable to predict the outcome of these assertions made against us. Any of these types of claims, regardless of the merits, could subject us to significant costs to defend or resolve such claims and may consume a substantial portion of management’s time and attention. As a result of these claims, we may be required to: • pay significant monetary damages, fines, royalties, or penalties; • enter into license or settlement agreements covering such intellectual property rights; • make material changes to or redesign our products and/or manufacturing processes; and/or • cease manufacturing, having made, selling, offering for sale, importing, marketing, or using products and/or manufacturing processes in certain jurisdictions. We may not be able to take any of the actions described above on commercially reasonable terms and any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. See “Part I. Financial Information – Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Contingencies.” We have a number of intellectual property license agreements. Some of these license agreements require us to make one-time or periodic payments. We may need to obtain additional licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future. We are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on terms acceptable to us. The failure to obtain or renew licenses as necessary could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 50 Table of Contents Risks Related to Laws and Regulations Government actions and regulations, such as export restrictions, tariffs, and trade protection measures, may limit our ability to sell our products to certain customers or markets, or could otherwise restrict our ability to conduct operations. International trade disputes, geopolitical tensions, and military conflicts have led, and continue to lead, to new and increasing export restrictions, trade barriers, tariffs, and other trade measures that can increase our manufacturing costs, make our products less competitive, reduce demand for our products, limit our ability to sell to certain customers or markets, limit our ability to procure, or increase our costs for, components or raw materials, impede or slow the movement of our goods across borders, impede our ability to perform R&D activities, or otherwise restrict our ability to conduct operations. Increasing protectionism, economic nationalism, and national security concerns may lead to further changes in trade policy, domestic sourcing initiatives, or other formal and informal measures that could make it more difficult to sell our products in, or restrict our access to, some markets and/or customers. For example, following the May 21, 2023 decision of its cybersecurity review of our products sold in China, the CAC determined that critical information infrastructure operators in China may not purchase Micron products, impacting our revenue with companies headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong, including direct sales as well as indirect sales through distributors. Some revenue with customers headquartered outside of China has also been impacted. Further actions by the Chinese government could impact additional revenue inside or outside China, or our operations in China, or our ability to ship products to our customers, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. We cannot predict what further actions may ultimately be taken with respect to export regulations, tariffs, or other trade regulations between the United States and other countries, what products or companies may be subject to such actions, or what actions may be taken by other countries in retaliation. Further changes in trade policy, tariffs, restrictions on exports or other trade barriers, or restrictions on supplies, equipment, and raw materials including rare earth minerals, may limit our ability to produce products, increase our selling and/or manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies. Such changes may also result in reputational harm to us, the development or adoption of technologies that compete with our products, long-term changes in global trade and technology supply chains, or negative impacts on our customers’ products which incorporate our solutions. Any of the effects described in this risk factor could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. The technology industry is subject to intense media, political, and regulatory scrutiny, which can increase our exposure to government investigations, legal actions, and penalties. Although we have policies, controls, and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, or agents will not violate such laws or our policies. Violations of trade laws, restrictions, or regulations can result in fines; criminal sanctions against us or our officers, directors, or employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. Tax-related matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes and cash tax liabilities in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including changes in the geographic mix of our earnings among jurisdictions, challenges by tax authorities to our tax positions and intercompany transfer pricing arrangements, failure to meet performance obligations with respect to tax incentive agreements, expanding our operations in various countries, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, adverse resolution of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns, and changes in tax laws and regulations. 51 | 2024 Q2 10-Q Table of Contents Changes to income tax laws and regulations, or the interpretation of such laws, in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could significantly increase our effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flows from operating activities and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Beginning in 2024, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 imposes a 15% book minimum tax on corporations with three-year average annual adjusted financial statement income exceeding $1 billion. The impact of this tax will depend on our facts in each year, anticipated guidance from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and other developing global tax legislation. Further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”). In December 2022, the European Union (“EU”) member states reached an agreement to implement the minimum tax component (“Pillar Two”) of the OECD’s tax reform initiative. The directive has been enacted or will be enacted retroactively to be in effect as of January 1, 2024 in nearly all EU member states. If similar directives under Pillar Two are adopted by taxing authorities in other countries where we do business, such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. We and others are subject to a variety of complex and evolving laws, regulations, or industry standards, including with respect to environmental, health, safety, and product considerations, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. The manufacture of our products requires the use of facilities, equipment, chemicals, and materials that are subject to a broad array of laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions in which we operate. Additionally, we are subject to a variety of other laws and regulations relative to the construction, maintenance, and operations of our facilities. Any changes in laws, regulations, or industry standards could cause us to incur additional direct costs, as well as increased indirect costs related to our relationships with our customers and suppliers, and otherwise harm our operations and financial condition. Any failure to comply with laws, regulations, or industry standards could adversely impact our reputation and our financial results. Additionally, we engage various third parties as sales channel partners or to represent us or otherwise act on our behalf who are also subject to a broad array of laws, regulations, and industry standards. Our engagement with these third parties may also expose us to risks associated with their respective compliance with laws and regulations. New and evolving environmental health, safety, and product considerations, including those related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, the purchase, use and disposal of regulated and/or hazardous chemicals, and the potential resulting environmental, health or safety impacts, may result in new laws, regulations, or industry standards that may affect us, our suppliers, and our customers. Such laws, regulations, or industry standards could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers, or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. New and evolving cybersecurity, data privacy, and artificial intelligence laws and regulations impose requirements for information confidentiality, integrity, availability, personal and proprietary data collection, storage, use, sharing, deletion, and artificial intelligence solutions that must be transparent, fair, secure, human-focused, and accountable. Such laws, standards, and market expectations could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers, or partners reluctance to share information or solutions due to actual or perceived inadequate controls. These costs may adversely impact our operations and financial condition. As a result of the considerations detailed in this risk factor, we could experience the following: • suspension of production or sales of our products; • limited supplies of chemicals or materials used to make our products; • remediation costs; • increased compliance costs; • alteration of our manufacturing processes; • regulatory penalties, fines, civil or criminal sanctions, and other legal liabilities; and • reputational challenges. Compliance with, or our failure, or the failure of our third-party sales channel partners or agents, to comply with, laws, regulations, or industry standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 52 Table of Contents Risks Related to Capitalization and Financial Markets We may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations, make scheduled debt payments, pay our dividend, and make adequate capital investments. Our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory and storage products sold, average selling prices, and manufacturing costs. To develop new product and process technology, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality, we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology, capital equipment, facilities, R&D, and product and process technology. We estimate capital expenditures in 2024 for property, plant, and equipment, net of partner contributions, to be in the range of $7.5 billion to $8.0 billion. In the past, we have utilized external sources of financing when needed. As a result of our debt levels, expected debt amortization, prevailing interest rates, and general capital market and other economic conditions, it may be difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. We have experienced volatility in our cash flows and operating results and we expect to continue to experience such volatility in the future, which may negatively affect our credit rating. Our credit rating may also be affected by our liquidity, financial results, economic risk, or other factors, which may increase the cost of borrowings and make it difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. There can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows, access capital or credit markets, or find other sources of financing to fund our operations, make debt payments, refinance our debt, pay our quarterly dividend, and make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency. Our inability to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Debt obligations could adversely affect our financial condition. We have incurred in the past, and expect to incur in the future, debt to finance our capital investments, business acquisitions, and to realign our capital structure. As of February 29, 2024, we had debt with a carrying value of $13.72 billion and may incur additional debt, including under our $2.50 billion Revolving Credit Facility. Our debt obligations could adversely impact us as follows: • require us to use a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on debt, which will reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund our business activities; • adversely impact our credit rating, which could increase borrowing costs; • limit our future ability to raise funds for capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, R&D, and other general corporate requirements; • restrict our ability to incur specified indebtedness, create or incur certain liens, and enter into sale-leaseback financing transactions; • increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; • increase our exposure to rising interest rates from variable rate indebtedness; and • result in certain of our debt instruments becoming immediately due and payable or being deemed to be in default if applicable cross default, cross-acceleration and/or similar provisions are triggered. 53 | 2024 Q2 10-Q Table of Contents Our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flows or obtain external financing in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to market, economic, financial, competitive, legislative, and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that additional capital will be available to us, in amounts sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs. Additionally, events and circumstances may occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy applicable draw-down conditions and utilize our Revolving Credit Facility. In light of industry conditions, in 2023, we amended the financial covenants in our Revolving Credit Facility and term loan agreements. See “Part I. Financial Information – Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Overview” and “Part I. Financial Information - Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Debt.” If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows to service our debt payment obligations or satisfy our debt covenants, we may need to refinance, restructure, or amend the terms of our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Across our global operations, significant transactions and balances are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (our reporting currency), primarily the Chinese yuan, euro, Indian rupee, Japanese yen, Malaysian ringgit, New Taiwan dollar, and Singapore dollar. In addition, a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in foreign currencies. Exchange rates for some of these currencies against the U.S. dollar have been volatile and may be volatile in future periods. If these currencies strengthen against the U.S. dollar, our manufacturing costs could significantly increase. Exchange rates for the U.S. dollar that adversely change against our foreign currency exposures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. We are subject to counterparty default risks. We have numerous arrangements with financial institutions that subject us to counterparty default risks, including cash deposits, investments, and derivative instruments. Additionally, we are subject to counterparty default risk from our customers for amounts receivable from them. As a result, we are subject to the risk that the counterparty will default on its performance obligations. A counterparty may not comply with its contractual commitments which could then lead to its defaulting on its obligations with little or no notice to us, which could limit our ability to mitigate our exposure. Additionally, our ability to mitigate our exposures may be constrained by the terms of our contractual arrangements or because market conditions prevent us from taking effective action. If one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterparty’s default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of such default, we could incur significant losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. The trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. Our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, we, the technology industry, and the stock market as a whole have on occasion experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to the specific operating performance of individual companies. The trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely due to various factors, including, but not limited to, actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results, changes in financial forecasts or estimates by us or financial or other market estimates and ratings by securities and other analysts, changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public, interest rate changes, regulatory changes, news regarding our products or products of our competitors, and broad market and industry fluctuations. For these reasons, investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future trading prices of our common stock, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Investors in our common stock may not realize any return on their investment in us and may lose some or all of their investment. Volatility in the trading price of our common stock could also result in the filing of securities class action litigation matters, which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources. 54 Table of Contents The amount and frequency of our share repurchases may fluctuate, and we cannot guarantee that we will fully consummate our share repurchase authorization, or that it will enhance long-term shareholder value. Share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and will diminish our cash reserves. The amount, frequency, and execution of our share repurchases pursuant to our share repurchase authorization may fluctuate based on our operating results, cash flows, and priorities for the use of cash for other purposes. Our expenditures for share repurchases were $425 million in 2023, $2.43 billion in 2022, $1.20 billion in 2021, $176 million in 2020, and $2.66 billion in 2019. These other purposes include, but are not limited to, operational spending, capital spending, acquisitions, and repayment of debt. Other factors, including changes in tax laws, could also impact our share repurchases. Although our Board of Directors has authorized share repurchases of up to $10 billion of our outstanding common stock, the authorization does not obligate us to repurchase any common stock. We cannot guarantee that our share repurchase authorization will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term shareholder value. The repurchase authorization could affect the trading price of our stock and increase volatility, and any announcement of a pause in, or termination of, this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock. In addition, this program will diminish our cash reserves. There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends in any particular amounts or at all. Our Board of Directors has adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which we currently pay a cash dividend on our common shares on a quarterly basis. The declaration and payment of any dividend is subject to the approval of our Board of Directors and our dividend may be discontinued or reduced at any time. There can be no assurance that we will declare cash dividends in the future in any particular amounts, or at all. Future dividends, if any, and their timing and amount, may be affected by, among other factors: our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions, debt service obligations, contractual restrictions, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. A reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock. 55 | 2024 Q2 10-Q Table of Contents ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS In May 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to $10 billion of our outstanding common stock through open-market purchases, block trades, privately-negotiated transactions, derivative transactions, and/or pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date, does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, and is subject to market conditions and our ongoing determination of the best use of available cash. During the quarter ended February 29, 2024, we did not repurchase any common stock under the authorization and as of February 29, 2024, $3.11 billion of the authorization remained available for the repurchase of our common stock. Shares of common stock withheld as payment of withholding taxes upon the vesting of restricted stock are also treated as common stock repurchases. Shares withheld as payment of withholding taxes upon the vesting of restricted stock units are not considered repurchases for purposes of this Item and are not required to be reported. In the second quarter of 2024, shares withheld as payment upon the vesting of restricted stock consisted of the following: Period Total number of shares purchased Average price paid per share Total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced plans or programs Approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under publicly announced plans or programs (in millions) December 1, 2023 — January 4, 2024 — $ — — January 5, 2024 – February 1, 2024 24,254 82.39 — February 2, 2024 – February 29, 2024 — — — 24,254 $ 82.39 — $3,106 56 Table of Contents ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION Securities Trading Plans of Directors and Executive Officers The following officer, as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act, adopted a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K, as follows: On January 30, 2024 , Scott DeBoer , our Executive Vice President, Technology and Products , adopted a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement providing for the sale of an aggregate of up to 40,000 shares of our common stock acquired by Mr. DeBoer pursuant to our Restricted Stock Awards. The trading arrangement is intended to satisfy the affirmative defense in Rule 10b5-1(c). The first date that sales of any shares are permitted to be sold under the trading arrangement will be May 1, 2024, and subsequent sales under the trading arrangement may occur on a regular basis for the duration of the trading arrangement until January 30, 2025 , or earlier if all transactions under the trading arrangement are completed. No other officers or directors, as defined in Rule 16a-1(f), adopted and/or terminated a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or a “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K, during the last fiscal quarter. 57 | 2024 Q2 10-Q Table of Contents ITEM 6.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (All tabular amounts in millions, except per share amounts) (Unaudited) Significant Accounting Policies For a discussion of our significant accounting policies, see “Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Significant Accounting Policies” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2023. There have been no changes to our significant accounting policies since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2023. Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Micron Technology, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) consistent in all material respects with those applied in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2023. In the opinion of our management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all necessary adjustments, consisting of a normal recurring nature, to fairly state the financial information set forth herein. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to current period presentation. Our fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period ending on the Thursday closest to August 31. Fiscal years 2024 and 2023 each contain 52 weeks. All period references are to our fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated. These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2023. Variable Interest Entities A number of special purpose entities (the \"Lease SPEs\") were created by a third-party to facilitate equipment lease financing transactions between us and financial institutions that fund the lease financing transactions (\"Financing Entities\"). Neither we nor the Financing Entities have an equity interest in the Lease SPEs. The Lease SPEs are variable interest entities because their equity is not sufficient to permit them to finance their activities without additional support from the Financing Entities and because the third-party equity holder lacks characteristics of a controlling financial interest. By design, the arrangements with the Lease SPEs are merely financing vehicles and we do not bear any significant risks from variable interests with the Lease SPEs. We have determined that we do not have the power to direct the activities of the Lease SPEs that most significantly impact their economic performance and we do not consolidate the Lease SPEs. As of May 30, 2024, we had approximately $ 600 million of financial lease liabilities and right-of-use assets under these arrangements. 11 | 2024 Q3 10-Q Table of Contents Cash and Investments All of our short-term investments and long-term marketable investments were classified as available-for-sale as of the dates noted below. Cash and equivalents and the fair values of our available-for-sale investments, which approximated amortized costs, were as follows: As of May 30, 2024 As of August 31, 2023 Cash and Equivalents Short-term Investments Long-term Marketable Investments (1) Total Fair Value Cash and Equivalents Short-term Investments Long-term Marketable Investments (1) Total Fair Value Cash $ 6,355 $ — $ — $ 6,355 $ 5,771 $ — $ — $ 5,771 Level 1 (2) Money market funds 570 — — 570 1,629 — — 1,629 Level 2 (3) Certificates of deposit 554 6 — 560 1,172 25 — 1,197 Corporate bonds — 454 418 872 — 737 437 1,174 Asset-backed securities — 42 337 379 — 15 387 402 Commercial paper 56 130 — 186 — 109 — 109 Government securities 59 153 20 232 5 131 20 156 7,594 $ 785 $ 775 $ 9,154 8,577 $ 1,017 $ 844 $ 10,438 Restricted cash (4) 70 79 Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 7,664 $ 8,656 (1) The maturities of long-term marketable investments primarily range from one to five years , except for asset-backed securities which are not due at a single maturity date. (2) The fair value of Level 1 securities is measured based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. (3) The fair value of Level 2 securities is measured using information obtained from pricing services, which obtain quoted market prices for similar instruments, non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data, or various other methodologies, to determine the appropriate value at the measurement date. We perform supplemental analysis to validate information obtained from these pricing services. No adjustments were made to the fair values indicated by such pricing information as of May 30, 2024 or August 31, 2023. (4) Restricted cash is included in other current assets and other noncurrent assets and primarily relates to certain government incentives received prior to being earned and for which restrictions lapse upon achieving certain performance conditions or which will be returned if performance conditions are not met. Gross realized gains and losses from sales of available-for-sale securities were not significant for any period presented. Non-marketable Equity Investments In addition to the amounts included in the table above, we had $ 192 million and $ 218 million of non-marketable equity investments without a readily determinable fair value that were included in other noncurrent assets as of May 30, 2024 and August 31, 2023, respectively. We recognized a net loss in other non-operating income (expense) on our non-marketable investments of $ 29 million for the first nine months of 2024. The amounts recognized for the other periods presented were not significant. Our non-marketable equity investments are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis and classified as Level 3. 12 Table of Contents Receivables As of May 30, 2024 August 31, 2023 Trade receivables $ 4,416 $ 2,048 Government incentives 340 105 Income and other taxes 208 194 Other 167 96 $ 5,131 $ 2,443 Inventories As of May 30, 2024 August 31, 2023 Finished goods $ 1,280 $ 1,616 Work in process 6,542 6,111 Raw materials and supplies 690 660 $ 8,512 $ 8,387 Property, Plant, and Equipment As of May 30, 2024 August 31, 2023 Land $ 284 $ 283 Buildings 19,134 17,967 Equipment (1) 68,426 65,555 Construction in progress (2) 3,351 2,464 Software 1,346 1,316 92,541 87,585 Accumulated depreciation ( 54,615 ) ( 49,657 ) $ 37,926 $ 37,928 (1) Includes costs related to equipment not placed into service of $ 1.77 billion as of May 30, 2024 and $ 2.91 billion as of August 31, 2023.

The resulting variable interest paid is at a rate equal to SOFR plus approximately 3.33 %. The fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges, and as a result, the carrying values of our 2027 Notes reflect adjustments in fair value. Debt Activity The table below presents the effects of debt financing and prepayment activities in the first nine months of 2024: Transaction Date Increase (Decrease) in Principal Increase (Decrease) in Carrying Value Increase (Decrease) in Cash Issuance 2031 Notes January 12, 2024 $ 1,000 $ 993 $ 993 Prepayments 2024 Term Loan A January 12, 2024 ( 588 ) ( 587 ) ( 588 ) 2025 Term Loan A January 12, 2024 ( 402 ) ( 401 ) ( 402 ) 2025 Term Loan A May 29, 2024 ( 650 ) ( 649 ) ( 650 ) $ ( 640 ) $ ( 644 ) $ ( 647 ) 2031 Notes On January 12, 2024, we issued $ 1.00 billion principal amount of senior unsecured 2031 Notes in a public offering. The 2031 Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.300 % per year and will mature on January 15, 2031. Issuance costs and debt discount for the 2031 Notes were $ 7 million. 16 Table of Contents We may redeem the 2031 Notes, in whole or in part, at our option prior to their maturity dates at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100 % of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed and (ii) the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest, plus accrued interest in each case. We may also redeem the 2031 Notes, in whole or in part, at a price equal to par two months prior to maturity in accordance with the terms of the 2031 Notes. The 2031 Notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit, in certain circumstances, our ability and/or the ability of our restricted subsidiaries (which are generally domestic subsidiaries in which we own at least 80 % of the voting stock and which own principal property, as defined in the indenture governing the 2031 Notes) to (1) create or incur certain liens; (2) enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions; and (3) consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer, or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets, to another entity. These covenants are subject to a number of limitations and exceptions. Additionally, if a change of control triggering event occurs, as defined in the indenture governing the 2031 Notes, we will be required to offer to purchase the 2031 Notes at 101 % of the outstanding aggregate principal amount plus accrued interest up to the purchase date. Revolving Credit Facility As of May 30, 2024, no amounts were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and $ 2.50 billion was available to us. Under the Revolving Credit Facility, borrowings would generally bear interest at a rate equal to adjusted term SOFR plus 1.00 % to 1.75 %, depending on our corporate credit ratings. Adjusted term SOFR for the Revolving Credit Facility agreement is the SOFR benchmark plus a credit spread adjustment ranging from approximately 0.11 % to 0.43 % depending on the applicable interest period selected. Any amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility would mature in May 2026 and amounts borrowed may be prepaid without penalty. The Revolving Credit Facility requires us to maintain, on a consolidated basis, a leverage ratio of total indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility and calculated as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, not to exceed 3.25 to 1.00. On March 27, 2023, we amended the Revolving Credit Facility to provide that in lieu of the foregoing leverage ratio, during the fourth quarter of 2023 and each quarter of 2024, we will be required to maintain, on a consolidated basis, a net leverage ratio of total net indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility and calculated as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, not to exceed 3.25 to 1.00. Alternatively, for up to three of such five quarters, we may elect to comply with a requirement of minimum liquidity, as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility, of not less than $ 5.0 billion. Each of the leverage ratio and net leverage ratio maximums, as applicable, is subject to a temporary four quarter increase in such ratio to 3.75 to 1.00 following certain material acquisitions. Through the third quarter of 2024, we complied with these requirements under the Revolving Credit Facility. Maturities of Notes Payable As of May 30, 2024, maturities of notes payable by fiscal year were as follows: Remainder of 2024 $ 27 2025 107 2026 607 2027 1,780 2028 1,493 2029 and thereafter 7,450 Unamortized issuance costs, discounts, and premium, net ( 34 ) Hedge accounting fair value adjustment ( 98 ) $ 11,332 17 | 2024 Q3 10-Q Table of Contents Contingencies We are currently a party to legal actions other than those described below arising from the normal course of business, none of which are expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Patent Matters As is typical in the semiconductor and other high-tech industries, from time to time, others have asserted, and may in the future assert, that our products or manufacturing processes infringe upon their intellectual property rights. A description of certain claims is below. On April 28, 2021, Netlist, Inc. (“Netlist”) filed two patent infringement actions against Micron, Micron Semiconductor Products, Inc. (“MSP”), and Micron Technology Texas, LLC (“MTEC”) in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. The first complaint alleges that one U.S. patent is infringed by certain of our non-volatile dual in-line memory modules. The second complaint alleges that three U.S. patents are infringed by certain of our load-reduced dual in-line memory modules (“LRDIMMs”). Each complaint seeks injunctive relief, damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. On March 31, 2022, Netlist filed a patent infringement complaint against Micron and Micron Semiconductor Germany, GmbH in Dusseldorf Regional Court alleging that two German patents are infringed by certain of our LRDIMMs. The complaint seeks damages, costs, and injunctive relief. On June 10, 2022, Netlist filed a patent infringement complaint against Micron, MSP, and MTEC in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (“E.D. Tex.”) alleging that six U.S. patents are infringed by certain of our memory modules and HBM products. On August 1, 2022, Netlist filed a second patent infringement complaint against the same defendants in E.D. Tex. alleging that one U.S. patent is infringed by certain of our LRDIMMs. On August 15, 2022, Netlist amended the second complaint to assert that two additional U.S. patents are infringed by certain of our LRDIMMs. The complaints in E.D. Tex. seek injunctive relief, damages, and attorneys’ fees. On May 23, 2024, following a four-day trial regarding the second complaint filed by Netlist in the E.D. Tex., a jury rendered a verdict that Micron’s memory modules infringe two asserted patents — U.S. Patent No. 7,619,912 (“the ‘912 patent”) and U.S. Patent No. 11,093,417 (“the ‘417 patent”) — and found that Micron should pay $ 425 million for infringement of the ‘912 patent and $ 20 million for infringement of the ‘417 patent. Micron expects to appeal the verdict. On April 17, 2024, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”) of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) issued a final written decision (“FWD”) finding unpatentable the sole asserted claim of the ‘912 patent. Netlist has sought review of that ruling by the Director of the USPTO. If the Director upholds the FWD, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit subsequently affirms the FWD, then the affirmed FWD will preclude any pending actions asserting infringement of the ‘912 patent (including any infringement verdict that is subject to an ongoing appeal). The PTAB’s final written decision regarding whether all claims of the ‘417 patent are also unpatentable is expected to be issued on or before August 2, 2024. On August 16, 2022, Sonrai Memory Ltd. filed a patent infringement complaint against Micron in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. The complaint alleges that two U.S. patents are infringed by certain SSD and NAND flash products. The complaint seeks damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. On January 23, 2023, Besang Inc. filed a patent infringement complaint against Micron in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges that one U.S. patent is infringed by certain of our 3D NAND and SSD products. The complaint seeks an injunction, damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. On November 9, 2023, Yangtze Memory Technologies Company, Ltd. (“YMTC”) filed a patent infringement complaint against Micron and one of its subsidiaries in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaint alleges that eight U.S. patents are infringed by certain of our 3D NAND products. The complaint seeks an injunction, damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. On January 22, 2024, Micron Semiconductor (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. (“MSS”) was served with three patent infringement complaints filed by YMTC in Beijing Intellectual Property Court and on February 27, 2024, Micron Technology, Inc. (“MTI”) was served with the same complaints. The complaints assert that MTI and MSS infringed three Chinese patents owned by YMTC by importing, selling, offering for sale, and assisting others to sell certain 3D NAND products and SSDs in China. The complaint seeks an injunction, damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. 18 Table of Contents On June 3, 2024, MimirIP LLC (“MimirIP”) submitted a complaint to the United States International Trade Commission (“ITC”) alleging that certain of Micron’s DRAM and NAND products infringe six patents owned by MimirIP. The complaint requests the ITC to institute an investigation of such alleged infringement pursuant to Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 and to issue a permanent limited exclusion order barring from entry into the United States such allegedly infringing DRAM and NAND devices and electronic devices containing the same produced by several alleged customers of Micron. On June 3, 2024, MimirIP filed a complaint against Micron, two of its subsidiaries, and certain alleged customers of Micron in the E.D. Tex. alleging that the same six patents as are asserted in the ITC are infringed by certain of Micron’s DRAM and NAND products. The complaint seeks damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. On June 4, 2024, MimirIP filed a second complaint against Micron, two of its subsidiaries, and certain alleged customers of Micron in the E.D. Tex. alleging that six additional patents are infringed by certain of Micron’s DRAM and NAND products. The complaint seeks damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. The above lawsuits pertain to substantially all of our DRAM, NAND, and other memory and storage products we manufacture, which account for substantially all of our revenue. Antitrust Matters On May 15, 2018, the Chinese State Administration for Market Regulation (“SAMR”) notified Micron that it was investigating potential collusion and other anticompetitive conduct by DRAM suppliers in China. On May 31, 2018, SAMR made unannounced visits to our sales offices in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen to seek certain information as part of its investigation. We are cooperating with SAMR in its investigation. Other Matters In the normal course of business, we are a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify another party. It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these types of agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, our payments under these types of agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Contingency Assessment We ar e unable to predict the outcome of any of the matters noted above and cannot make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of possible losses. A determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others or entering into a license agreement covering such intellectual property could result in significant liability and/or require us to make material changes to our products and/or manufacturing processes. Any of the foregoing, as well as the resolution of any other legal matter noted above, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Equity Common Stock Repurchases In May 2018, our Board of Directors authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to $ 10 billion of our outstanding common stock through open-market purchases, block trades, privately-negotiated transactions, derivative transactions, and/or pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date, does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, and is subject to market conditions and our ongoing determination of the best use of available cash. No shares were repurchased under this authorization in the first nine months of 2024. Through May 30, 2024, we had repurchased an aggregate of $ 6.89 billion under the authorization. Amounts repurchased are included in treasury stock. 19 | 2024 Q3 10-Q Table of Contents Dividends We paid dividends of $ 128 million ($ 0.115 per share), $ 127 million ($ 0.115 per share), and $ 129 million ($ 0.115 per share) in the third, second, and first quarters of 2024, respectively. On June 26, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $ 0.115 per share, payable in cash on July 23, 2024 , to shareholders of record as of the close of business on July 8, 2024 . Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by component for the nine months ended May 30, 2024 were as follows: Gains (Losses) on Derivative Instruments Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Investments Pension Liability Adjustments Cumulative Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment Total As of August 31, 2023 $ ( 304 ) $ ( 41 ) $ 36 $ ( 3 ) $ ( 312 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ( 151 ) 16 — — ( 135 ) Amount reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 139 — ( 3 ) — 136 Tax effects ( 2 ) 1 1 — — Other comprehensive income (loss) ( 14 ) 17 ( 2 ) — 1 As of May 30, 2024 $ ( 318 ) $ ( 24 ) $ 34 $ ( 3 ) $ ( 311 ) Fair Value Measurements The estimated fair values and carrying values of our outstanding debt instruments were as follows: As of May 30, 2024 As of August 31, 2023 Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Notes $ 11,037 $ 11,332 $ 11,549 $ 12,049 The fair values of our debt instruments were estimated based on Level 2 inputs, including the trading price of our notes when available, discounted cash flows, and interest rates based on similar debt issued by parties with credit ratings similar to ours. 20 Table of Contents Derivative Instruments Notional or Contractual Amount Fair Value of Assets (1) Liabilities (2) As of May 30, 2024 Derivative instruments with hedge accounting designation Cash flow currency hedges $ 4,177 $ 2 $ ( 234 ) Cash flow commodity hedges 458 25 ( 4 ) Fair value interest rate hedges 900 — ( 98 ) Derivative instruments without hedge accounting designation Non-designated currency hedges 1,964 4 ( 12 ) $ 31 $ ( 348 ) As of August 31, 2023 Derivative instruments with hedge accounting designation Cash flow currency hedges $ 3,873 $ 16 $ ( 180 ) Cash flow commodity hedges 331 45 — Fair value interest rate hedges 900 — ( 100 ) Derivative instruments without hedge accounting designation Non-designated currency hedges 1,839 2 ( 17 ) $ 63 $ ( 297 ) (1) Included in receivables and other noncurrent assets. (2) Included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other noncurrent liabilities. Derivative Instruments with Hedge Accounting Designation Cash Flow Hedges : We utilize forward and swap contracts that generally mature within two years designated as cash flow hedges to minimize our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates or commodity prices for certain capital expenditures and manufacturing costs. Forward and swap contracts are measured at fair value based on market-based observable inputs including market spot and forward rates, interest rates, and credit-risk spreads (Level 2). The effects of cash flow hedging activities were as follows: Quarter ended Nine months ended May 30, 2024 June 1, 2023 May 30, 2024 June 1, 2023 Gain (loss) from cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) $ ( 99 ) $ ( 40 ) $ ( 142 ) $ 88 Gain (loss) excluded from effectiveness testing in cost of goods sold ( 35 ) ( 26 ) ( 105 ) ( 71 ) Gain (loss) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings, primarily to cost of goods sold ( 39 ) ( 77 ) ( 139 ) ( 199 ) As of May 30, 2024, we expect to reclassify $ 168 million of pre-tax losses related to cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings in the next 12 months. 21 | 2024 Q3 10-Q Table of Contents Fair Value Hedges : We utilize fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges to minimize certain exposures to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt that result from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates. Interest rate swaps are measured at fair value based on market-based observable inputs including interest rates and credit-risk spreads (Level 2). The changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as fair value hedges and the offsetting changes in the underlying fair values of the hedged items are both recognized in earnings. When a derivative is no longer designated as a fair value hedge for any reason, including termination and maturity, the remaining unamortized difference between the carrying value of the hedged item at that time and the face value of the hedged item is amortized to earnings over the remaining life of the hedged item, or immediately if the hedged item has matured or been extinguished. The effects of fair value hedges on our consolidated statements of operations, recognized in interest expense, were not significant for the periods presented. Derivative Instruments without Hedge Accounting Designation Currency Derivatives : We generally utilize a rolling hedge strategy with currency forward contracts that mature within three months to hedge our exposures of monetary assets and liabilities from changes in currency exchange rates. At the end of each reporting period, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are remeasured into U.S. dollars and the associated outstanding forward contracts are marked to market. Currency forward contracts are valued at fair values based on the middle of bid and ask prices of dealers or exchange quotations (Level 2). Realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments without hedge accounting designation as well as the changes in the underlying monetary assets and liabilities from changes in currency exchange rates are included in other non-operating income (expense), net. The amounts recognized for derivative instruments without hedge accounting designation were not significant for the periods presented. We do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes. Equity Plans As of May 30, 2024, 72 million shares of our common stock were available for future awards under our equity plans, including 12 million shares approved for issuance under our employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”). Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units (“Restricted Stock Awards”) Restricted Stock Awards activity is summarized as follows: Nine months ended May 30, 2024 June 1, 2023 Restricted stock award shares granted 12 14 Weighted-average grant-date fair value per share $ 69.02 $ 54.13 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) For each six -month ESPP offering period that ended in the second quarter of 2024 and 2023, employees purchased 2 million and 3 million shares, respectively, at a share price of $ 60.68 and $ 52.45 , respectively. 22 Table of Contents Stock-based Compensation Expense Stock-based compensation expense recognized in our statements of operations is presented below. Stock-based compensation expense of $ 100 million and $ 88 million was capitalized and remained in inventory as of May 30, 2024 and August 31, 2023, respectively.

Revenue is primarily recognized at a point in time when control of the promised goods is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods. Substantially all contracts with our customers are short-term in duration at fixed, negotiated prices with payment generally due shortly after delivery. From time to time, we have contracts with initial terms that include performance obligations that extend beyond one year. As of May 30, 2024, our future performance obligations beyond one year were $ 141 million, which included customer prepayments and other contract liabilities. Customer prepayments made to secure product supply in future periods and other contract liabilities were $ 756 million as of May 30, 2024, of which $ 615 million was reported in other current liabilities and the remainder in other noncurrent liabilities. As of May 30, 2024 and August 31, 2023, other current liabilities also included $ 617 million and $ 453 million, respectively, for estimates of consideration payable to customers including estimates for pricing adjustments and returns. Restructure and Asset Impairments Quarter ended Nine months ended May 30, 2024 June 1, 2023 May 30, 2024 June 1, 2023 Employee severance $ — $ 70 $ — $ 163 Asset impairments and other asset-related costs — 1 — 9 Other — ( 3 ) — ( 5 ) $ — $ 68 $ — $ 167 In 2023, we initiated a restructure plan in response to challenging industry conditions (the “2023 Restructure Plan”). Under the 2023 Restructure Plan, we reduced our headcount by approximately 15 % by the end of calendar 2023, through a combination of voluntary attrition and personnel reductions. The plan was substantially completed in 2023. 24 Table of Contents Other Operating (Income) Expense, Net Quarter ended Nine months ended May 30, 2024 June 1, 2023 May 30, 2024 June 1, 2023 (Gain) loss on disposition of property, plant, and equipment $ ( 38 ) $ ( 24 ) $ ( 63 ) $ ( 46 ) Patent cross-license agreement gain — — ( 200 ) — Litigation settlement — 68 — 68 Other 10 4 ( 4 ) 7 $ ( 28 ) $ 48 $ ( 267 ) $ 29 Income Taxes Our income tax (provision) benefit consisted of the following: Quarter ended Nine months ended May 30, 2024 June 1, 2023 May 30, 2024 June 1, 2023 Income (loss) before taxes $ 715 $ ( 1,753 ) $ ( 270 ) $ ( 4,200 ) Income tax (provision) benefit ( 377 ) ( 139 ) 172 ( 201 ) Effective tax rate 52.7 % ( 7.9 ) % 63.7 % ( 4.8 ) % In the first quarter of 2024, our tax expense was based on actual results for jurisdictions where small changes in our projected pre-tax income would have caused significant changes in the estimated annual effective tax rate. With our improved fiscal 2024 outlook, we were able to estimate a more reliable annual effective tax rate and have reverted to a global annual effective tax rate method for all jurisdictions beginning in the second quarter of 2024. The changes in our effective tax rate for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 as compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 were primarily due to changes in profitability and discrete items primarily related to tax return filings. We operate in a number of jurisdictions outside the United States, including Singapore, where we have tax incentive arrangements. These incentives expire, in whole or in part, at various dates through 2034 and are conditional, in part, upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds. As a result of the low level of profitability and the geographic mix of income, the benefit from tax incentive arrangements was not material for the periods presented. As of May 30, 2024, other current assets included $ 539 million related to income taxes. 25 | 2024 Q3 10-Q Table of Contents Earnings Per Share Quarter ended Nine months ended May 30, 2024 June 1, 2023 May 30, 2024 June 1, 2023 Net income (loss) – Basic and Diluted $ 332 $ ( 1,896 ) $ ( 109 ) $ ( 4,403 ) Weighted-average common shares outstanding – Basic 1,107 1,094 1,104 1,092 Dilutive effect of equity plans 16 — — — Weighted-average common shares outstanding – Diluted 1,123 1,094 1,104 1,092 Earnings (loss) per share Basic $ 0.30 $ ( 1.73 ) $ ( 0.10 ) $ ( 4.03 ) Diluted 0.30 ( 1.73 ) ( 0.10 ) ( 4.03 ) Antidilutive potential common shares excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share, that could dilute basic earnings per share in the future, were 1 million and 31 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, and were 31 million and 33 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2023. All period references are to our fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated. Our fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period ending on the Thursday closest to August 31. Fiscal 2024 and 2023 each contain 52 weeks. All tabular dollar amounts are in millions, except per share amounts. Overview We are an industry leader in innovative memory and storage solutions transforming how the world uses information to enrich life for all . With a relentless focus on our customers, technology leadership, and manufacturing and operational excellence, Micron delivers a rich portfolio of high-performance DRAM, NAND, and NOR memory and storage products through our Micron® and Crucial® brands. Every day, the innovations that our people create fuel the data economy, enabling advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and compute-intensive applications that unleash opportunities — from the data center to the intelligent edge and across the client and mobile user experience. We manufacture our products at wholly-owned facilities and also utilize subcontractors for certain manufacturing processes. Our global network of manufacturing centers of excellence not only allows us to benefit from scale while streamlining processes and operations, but it also brings together some of the world’s brightest talent to work on the most advanced memory technology. Centers of excellence bring expertise together in one location, providing an efficient support structure for end-to-end manufacturing, with quicker cycle times, in partnership with teams such as research and development (“R&D”), product development, human resources, procurement, and supply chain. For our locations in Singapore and Taiwan, this is also a combination of bringing fabrication and back-end manufacturing together. We make significant investments to develop proprietary product and process technology, which generally increases bit density per wafer and reduces per-bit manufacturing costs of each generation of product. We continue to introduce new generations of products that offer improved performance characteristics, including higher data transfer rates, advanced packaging solutions, lower power consumption, improved read/write reliability, and increased memory density. We face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets. To remain competitive we must continuously develop and implement new products and technologies and decrease manufacturing costs in spite of ongoing inflationary cost pressures. Our success is largely dependent on obtaining returns on our R&D investments, efficient utilization of our manufacturing infrastructure, development and integration of advanced product and process technologies, market acceptance of our diversified portfolio of semiconductor-based memory and storage solutions, and efficient capital spending. Product Technologies Our product portfolio of memory and storage solutions, advanced solutions, and storage platforms is based on our high-performance semiconductor memory and storage technologies, including DRAM, NAND, and NOR. We sell our products into various markets through our business units in numerous forms, including components, modules, SSDs, managed NAND, MCPs, HBM, and wafers. Our system-level solutions, including SSDs and managed NAND, combine NAND, a controller, firmware, and in some cases DRAM. DRAM : DRAM products are dynamic random access memory semiconductor devices with low latency that provide high-speed data retrieval with a variety of performance characteristics. DRAM products lose content when power is turned off (“volatile”) and are most commonly used in client, cloud server, enterprise, networking, graphics, industrial, and automotive markets. LPDRAM products, which are engineered to meet standards for performance and power consumption, are sold into smartphone and other mobile-device markets (including client markets for Chromebooks, notebook PCs, and gaming consoles), as well as into the automotive, industrial, consumer, and datacenter markets. HBM is a stacked DRAM technology optimized for memory-bandwidth intensive applications. 28 Table of Contents NAND : NAND products are non-volatile, re-writeable semiconductor storage devices that provide high-capacity, low-cost storage with a variety of performance characteristics. NAND is used in SSDs for the enterprise and cloud, client, consumer, and automotive markets and in removable storage markets. Managed NAND is used in smartphones and other mobile devices, and in consumer, automotive, and embedded markets. Low-density NAND is ideal for applications like automotive, surveillance, machine-to-machine, automation, printer, and home networking. NOR : NOR products are non-volatile, re-writable semiconductor memory devices that provide fast read speeds. NOR is most commonly used for reliable code storage (e.g., boot, application, operating system, and execute-in-place code in an embedded system) and for frequently changing small data storage and is ideal for automotive, industrial, and consumer applications. Industry Conditions The memory and storage industry environment deteriorated sharply in the fourth quarter of 2022 and through 2023 due to weak demand in many end markets combined with global and macroeconomic challenges and lower demand resulting from customer actions to reduce inventory levels. This led to significant reductions in average selling prices for both DRAM and NAND and reductions in bit shipments for DRAM, resulting in declines in revenue across all our business segments and nearly all our end markets. For the first nine months of 2024, increasing demand growth, driven in part by deployment of artificial intelligence and mostly normal customer inventories, combined with industry-wide supply discipline, resulted in an improved industry supply and demand balance. As a result, we have experienced improvements in pricing and margins in 2024. We reduced capital expenditures and wafer starts for both DRAM and NAND in response to challenging market conditions that began in the latter part of 2022 and increased levels of our inventories. In the first quarter of 2024, we recognized $165 million of period costs due to wafer start reductions. In the second and third quarters of 2024, fabrication facility underutilization was reduced and principally related to legacy manufacturing capacity, accordingly period costs were not significant. In addition, to improve capital efficiency, we have redeployed equipment from older technology nodes to support conversions to leading-edge nodes. Since the number of wafer processing steps is higher for leading-edge nodes, this approach has resulted in a meaningful structural reduction in DRAM and NAND wafer capacity. We are now fully utilized on our high-volume manufacturing nodes where we are maximizing output against the structurally lowered capacity. We believe this approach to node migration and consequent wafer capacity reduction is an industry-wide phenomenon. Impact of China Cyberspace Administration Decision On March 31, 2023, China’s Cyberspace Administration (the “CAC”) notified us that it was conducting a cybersecurity review of our products sold in China. On May 21, 2023, we received notice that the CAC had concluded its review and decided that our products presented a cybersecurity risk. As such, the CAC determined that critical information infrastructure operators in China may not purchase Micron products. The CAC decision has impacted our business, particularly in the domestic data center and networking markets in China, and we have been working to mitigate that impact. Our goal is to retain our worldwide DRAM and NAND market share. 29 | 2024 Q3 10-Q Table of Contents Results of Operations Consolidated Results Third Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Nine months ended 2024 2024 2023 2024 2023 Revenue $ 6,811 100 % $ 5,824 100 % $ 3,752 100 % $ 17,361 100 % $ 11,530 100 % Cost of goods sold 4,979 73 % 4,745 81 % 4,420 118 % 14,485 83 % 12,511 109 % Gross margin 1,832 27 % 1,079 19 % (668) (18) % 2,876 17 % (981) (9) % Research and development 850 12 % 832 14 % 758 20 % 2,527 15 % 2,395 21 % Selling, general, and administrative 291 4 % 280 5 % 219 6 % 834 5 % 701 6 % Restructure and asset impairments — — % — — % 68 2 % — — % 167 1 % Other operating (income) expense, net (28) — % (224) (4) % 48 1 % (267) (2) % 29 — % Operating income (loss) 719 11 % 191 3 % (1,761) (47) % (218) (1) % (4,273) (37) % Interest income (expense), net (14) — % (14) — % 8 — % (28) — % 75 1 % Other non-operating income (expense), net 10 — % (7) — % — — % (24) — % (2) — % Income tax (provision) benefit (377) (6) % 622 11 % (139) (4) % 172 1 % (201) (2) % Equity in net income (loss) of equity method investees (6) — % 1 — % (4) — % (11) — % (2) — % Net income (loss) $ 332 5 % $ 793 14 % $ (1,896) (51) % $ (109) (1) % $ (4,403) (38) % Total Revenue: Total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was impacted by the factors described in the section titled “Industry Conditions” above. These conditions drove significant quarterly declines in average selling prices throughout 2023 and a subsequent recovery of average selling prices in the first three quarters of 2024. Total revenue for the third quarter of 2024 increased 17% as compared to the second quarter of 2024 due to increases in sales of both DRAM and NAND products. • Sales of DRAM products in the third quarter of 2024 increased 13% as compared to the second quarter of 2024 primarily due to increases in average selling prices by approximately 20%, partially offset by a mid-single-digit percent range decrease in bit shipments. • Sales of NAND products in the third quarter of 2024 increased 32% as compared to the second quarter of 2024 primarily due to an approximate 20% increase in average selling prices and a high-single-digit percent range increase in bit shipments. Total revenue for the third quarter of 2024 increased 82% as compared to the third quarter of 2023 due to increases in sales of both DRAM and NAND products. • Sales of DRAM products in the third quarter of 2024 increased 76% as compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to a mid-30% range increase in both average selling prices and bit shipments. • Sales of NAND products in the third quarter of 2024 increased 104% as compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to a low-60% range increase in average selling prices and a high-20% range increase in bit shipments. 30 Table of Contents Total revenue for the first nine months of 2024 increased 51% as compared to the first nine months of 2023 due to increases in both DRAM and NAND sales. • Sales of DRAM products in the first nine months of 2024 increased 49% as compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to a mid-50% range increase in bit shipments, partially offset by a low-single-digit percentage range decline in average selling prices. • Sales of NAND products in the first nine months of 2024 increased 62% as compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to a low-50% range increase in bit shipments and a high-single-digit percentage range increase in average selling prices. Consolidated Gross Margin : Our consolidated gross margin has been impacted by the factors described in the section titled “Industry Conditions” above and inventory write-downs in 2023 as detailed in the table below. Our consolidated gross margin percentage improved to 27% for the third quarter of 2024 from 19% for the second quarter of 2024, as a result of improvements in margins for both DRAM and NAND products, primarily due to increases in average selling prices and NAND manufacturing cost reductions, partially offset by a reduction in the benefits from the sale of inventories previously written down to their net realizable value. Our consolidated gross margin percentage improved to 27% for the third quarter of 2024 from negative 18% for the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to increases in average selling prices, manufacturing cost reductions, the effects of charges to write down inventories to their NRV in 2023, and the sale of previously written down inventories. Our consolidated gross margin percentage improved to 17% for the first nine months of 2024 from negative 9% for the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to manufacturing cost reductions, the effects of charges to write down inventories to their NRV in 2023, and the sale of previously written down inventories. Inventory NRV write-downs: Our consolidated gross margin was impacted by charges in the second and third quarters of 2023 to write inventories down to their estimated NRV as a result of declines in average selling prices for both DRAM and NAND. As charges to write down inventories are recorded in advance of when inventories are sold, costs of goods sold in subsequent periods are lower than they otherwise would be. The impact of inventory NRV write-downs for each period reflects (1) inventory write-downs in that period, offset by (2) lower costs in that period on the sale of inventory written down in prior periods. The impacts of inventory NRV write-downs are summarized below: Third Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Nine months ended 2024 2024 2023 2024 2023 Provision to write down inventory to NRV $ — $ — $ (401) $ — $ (1,831) Lower costs from sale of inventory written down in prior periods — 382 281 987 281 $ — $ 382 $ (120) $ 987 $ (1,550) Revenue by Business Unit Third Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Nine months ended 2024 2024 2023 2024 2023 CNBU $ 2,573 38 % $ 2,185 38 % $ 1,389 37 % $ 6,495 37 % $ 4,510 39 % MBU 1,588 23 % 1,598 27 % 819 22 % 4,479 26 % 2,419 21 % EBU 1,294 19 % 1,111 19 % 912 24 % 3,442 20 % 2,777 24 % SBU 1,353 20 % 905 16 % 627 17 % 2,911 17 % 1,814 16 % All Other 3 — % 25 — % 5 — % 34 — % 10 — % $ 6,811 $ 5,824 $ 3,752 $ 17,361 $ 11,530 Percentages of total revenue may not total 100% due to rounding. 31 | 2024 Q3 10-Q Table of Contents Changes in revenue for each business unit for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the second quarter of 2024 were as follows: • CNBU revenue increased 18% primarily due to increases in DRAM average selling prices driven by strong growth in the data center market. • MBU revenue decreased 1% reflecting decreases in bit shipments, partially offset by increases in average selling prices for both mobile DRAM and NAND. • EBU revenue increased 16% primarily due to increases in DRAM average selling prices and bit shipments driven by strong demand in automotive markets. • SBU revenue increased 50% primarily due to increases in NAND average selling prices and bit shipments driven by strong demand in data center markets. Changes in revenue for each business unit for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 as compared to the corresponding periods of 2023 were as follows: • CNBU revenue increased 85% and 44%, respectively, driven by increases in bit shipments. CNBU DRAM average selling prices increased for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023 and decreased slightly for the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023. • MBU revenue increased 94% and 85%, respectively, primarily due to increases in average selling prices and bit shipments for both mobile DRAM and NAND. • EBU revenue increased 42% and 24%, respectively, primarily due to increases in bit shipments, partially offset by declines in average selling prices. • SBU revenue increased 116% and 60%, respectively, primarily due to increases in average selling prices and bit shipments.

For the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the second quarter of 2024, operating income (loss) improved for all segments primarily due to increases in average selling prices as a result of improving conditions across most markets. 32 Table of Contents For the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023, CNBU, MBU, and SBU operating income (loss) improved primarily due to increases in average selling prices, manufacturing cost reductions, and increases in bit sales as a result of improving conditions across most markets in 2024. SBU and CNBU experienced higher R&D expenses for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023. For EBU, operating income (loss) for the third quarter of 2024 also improved from the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to increases in bits sold and manufacturing cost reductions, partially offset by lower average selling prices. For the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023, operating income (loss) improved for CNBU, MBU, and SBU primarily due to manufacturing cost reductions, increases in bit sales, and increases in MBU and SBU average selling prices as a result of improving conditions across most markets in 2024. SBU and CNBU experienced higher R&D expenses for the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023. For EBU, operating income (loss) for the first nine months of 2024 deteriorated from the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to lower average selling prices, partially offset by manufacturing cost reduction and increases in bit shipments. Operating Expenses and Other Research and Development: R&D expenses vary primarily with the number of development and pre-qualification wafers processed, the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development, and personnel costs. Because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products, we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing. Development of a product is deemed complete when it is qualified through internal reviews and tests for performance and reliability. R&D expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification. R&D expenses for the third quarter of 2024 increased 2% as compared to the second quarter of 2024 primarily due to an increase in employee compensation and subcontractor expense. R&D expenses for the third quarter of 2024 increased 12% as compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to an increase in employee compensation and subcontractor expense, partially offset by an increase in government incentives. R&D expenses for the first nine months of 2024 increased 6% as compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to an increase in employee compensation, partially offset by an increase in government incentives. Selling, General, and Administrative: SG&A expenses for the third quarter of 2024 increased 4% as compared to the second quarter of 2024 primarily due to an increase in employee compensation. SG&A expenses for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 increased 33% and 19%, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods of 2023, primarily due to an increase in employee compensation and legal fees. Restructure and Asset Impairments: See “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Restructure and Asset Impairments.” Other Operating (Income) Expense, Net: See “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Other Operating (Income) Expense, Net.” Interest (Income) Expense, Net: Interest income (expense) for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024 was unchanged. Interest income (expense) deteriorated for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 as compared to the corresponding periods of 2023 primarily due to increases in interest expense as a result of higher debt balances and interest rates, partially offset by increases in interest income due to higher interest rates on our cash and investments. Income Taxes: Our income tax (provision) benefit consisted of the following: Third Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Nine months ended 2024 2024 2023 2024 2023 Income (loss) before taxes $ 715 $ 170 $ (1,753) $ (270) $ (4,200) Income tax (provision) benefit (377) 622 (139) 172 (201) Effective tax rate 52.7 % (365.9) % (7.9) % 63.7 % (4.8) % 33 | 2024 Q3 10-Q Table of Contents In the first quarter of 2024, our tax expense was based on actual results for jurisdictions where small changes in our projected pre-tax income would have caused significant changes in the estimated annual effective tax rate. With our improved fiscal 2024 outlook, we were able to estimate a more reliable annual effective tax rate and have reverted to a global annual effective tax rate method for all jurisdictions beginning in the second quarter of 2024. The change in our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the second quarter of 2024 was primarily due to the change in tax rate methodology applied in the second quarter of 2024. The changes in our effective tax rate for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 as compared to the corresponding periods of 2023 were primarily due to changes in profitability and discrete items primarily related to tax return filings. We operate in a number of jurisdictions outside the United States, including Singapore, where we have tax incentive arrangements. These incentives expire, in whole or in part, at various dates through 2034 and are conditional, in part, upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds. As a result of the low level of profitability and the geographical mix of income, the benefit from tax incentive arrangements was not material for the periods presented. Various tax reforms are being considered in multiple jurisdictions that, if enacted, contain provisions that could materially impact our tax expense. We continue to monitor the potential impact of these various tax reform proposals to our overall global effective tax rate and financial statements. Other: Further information can be found in “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Equity Plans”. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and financing obtained from capital markets and financial institutions. Cash generated from operations is highly dependent on selling prices for our products, which can vary significantly from period to period. Cash and marketable investments totaled $9.15 billion as of May 30, 2024, and $10.44 billion as of August 31, 2023. Our cash and investments consist primarily of bank deposits, money market funds, and liquid investment-grade, fixed-income securities, which are diversified among industries and individual issuers. To mitigate credit risk, we invest through high-credit-quality financial institutions and by policy generally limit the concentration of credit exposure by restricting the amount of investments with any single obligor. As of May 30, 2024, $2.51 billion of our cash and marketable investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries. We continuously evaluate alternatives for efficiently funding our capital expenditures and ongoing operations. From time to time, we expect to engage in a variety of financing transactions for such purposes as well as to refinance our existing indebtedness, including the issuance of securities. As of May 30, 2024, $2.50 billion was available to draw under our Revolving Credit Facility. Funding of certain significant capital projects is also dependent on the receipt of government incentives, which are subject to conditions and may not be obtained. To develop new product and process technology, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality, we must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies, facilities and equipment, and R&D. We estimate capital expenditures in 2024 for property, plant, and equipment, net of proceeds from government incentives, to be approximately $8.0 billion. Actual amounts for 2024 will vary depending on market conditions and may vary from quarter to quarter due to the timing of expenditures. As of May 30, 2024, we had purchase obligations of approximately $1.31 billion for the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment, of which approximately $1.20 billion is expected to be paid within one year. For a description of other contractual obligations, such as leases and debt, see “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Leases,” and “ – Debt.” 34 Table of Contents To support expected memory demand in the second half of the decade, we will need to add new DRAM wafer capacity. Following the enactment of the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 (“CHIPS Act”), we announced plans to invest in two leading-edge memory manufacturing fab facilities in the United States, contingent on CHIPS Act support through grants and investment tax credits. As part of this plan, in September 2022, we broke ground on a leading-edge memory manufacturing fab in Boise, Idaho. Construction of the fab began in October 2023 with DRAM production targeted to start in early calendar 2026 and first output in mid calendar 2026. In addition, in October 2022, we announced plans to build a second leading-edge DRAM manufacturing facility, consisting of up to four fabs to be built over the next 20-plus years, in Clay, New York. We expect construction site preparation to begin in calendar 2025, with production anticipated to ramp in the latter half of the decade. We expect these new fabs to be key to meeting our requirements for additional wafer capacity starting in the second half of the decade and beyond, in line with industry demand trends. We have signed a non-binding preliminary memorandum of terms with the U.S. Department of Commerce for up to $6.1 billion in direct funding under the CHIPS Act for our planned fab in Boise, Idaho and the first two planned fabs in Clay, New York. We are also eligible for federal loans up to $7.5 billion. In addition, we receive a 25% investment tax credit on qualified investments in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing under the CHIPS Act. We have also signed a non-binding term sheet with the state of New York that provides up to $5.5 billion in funding for the planned four-fab facility over the next 20-plus years through a combination of tax credits for qualified capital investments and incentives for eligible new job wages. Additionally, we began enablement of cleanroom space within our existing manufacturing fab in Hiroshima, Japan, that will support production of DRAM using EUV lithography. We also continue to advance our global back-end assembly and test network in order to support our product portfolio and extend our ability to deliver on global customer demand in the future. We have started construction to expand our existing assembly and test facility in Xi’an, China, to provide space to add more product capability, to allow us over time to serve more of the demand from our customers in China. Construction is also progressing for the assembly and test facility in Gujarat, India to address demand in the latter half of this decade. Our Board of Directors has authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to $10 billion of our outstanding common stock through open-market purchases, block trades, privately-negotiated transactions, derivative transactions, and/or pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date, does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, and is subject to market conditions and our ongoing determination of the best use of available cash. Through May 30, 2024, we had repurchased an aggregate of $6.89 billion of the authorized amount. See “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Equity.” On June 26, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.115 per share, payable in cash on July 23, 2024, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on July 8, 2024. The declaration and payment of any future cash dividends are at the discretion and subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors' decisions regarding the amount and payment of dividends will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions, debt service obligations, contractual restrictions, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. We expect that our cash and investments, cash flows from operations, expected funding from government incentives, and available financing will be sufficient to meet our requirements at least through the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Cash Flows Nine months ended 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 5,102 $ 1,310 Net cash provided by (used for) investing activities (4,711) (5,361) Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities (1,368) 5,095 Effect of changes in currency exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash (15) (13) Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ (992) $ 1,031 35 | 2024 Q3 10-Q Table of Contents Operating Activities: Cash provided by operating activities reflects net income (loss) adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation expense, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, and inventory write-downs, and the effects of changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in cash provided by operating activities for the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023 was primarily due to a smaller net loss in the current year adjusted for non-cash items, the effect of an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and an increase in other current liabilities largely due to approximately $600 million of customer prepayments to secure product supply, partially offset by an increase in receivables. Investing Activities: For the first nine months of 2024, net cash used for investing activities consisted primarily of $5.27 billion of expenditures for property, plant, and equipment, partially offset by contributions of $267 million received from government incentives to offset capital expenditures and $323 million of net inflows from maturities, sales, and purchases of available-for-sale securities. For the first nine months of 2023, net cash used for investing activities consisted primarily of $6.22 billion of expenditures for property, plant, and equipment, partially offset by contributions of $248 million received from government incentives to offset capital expenditures and $696 million of net inflows from maturities, sales, and purchases of available-for-sale securities. Financing Activities: For the first nine months of 2024, net cash used for financing activities consisted primarily of $1.82 billion of repayments of debt, which included the prepayment of the 2024 Term Loan A and the 2025 Term Loan A borrowings, $384 million for payments of dividends to shareholders, and $127 million of payments on equipment purchase contracts, partially offset by approximately $1.00 billion of proceeds from the issuance of the 2031 Notes. See “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Debt.” For the first nine months of 2023, net cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of $3.20 billion of proceeds from our 2025, 2026, and 2027 Term Loan A borrowings, $1.27 billion from the issuance of the 2029 B Notes, $896 million from the issuance of the 2033 B Notes, $749 million from the issuance of the 2033 A Notes, and $599 million from the issuance of the 2028 Notes. Cash used for financing activities included $706 million for repayments of debt, $425 million for the acquisition of 8.6 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase authorization, $378 million for payments of dividends to shareholders, and $112 million of payments on equipment purchase contracts.

We have experienced significant volatility in our average selling prices and may continue to experience such volatility in the future. For example, average selling prices for DRAM declined in the high-40s percent range and NAND declined in the low-50s percent range for 2023 as compared to 2022. Since 2017, annual percentage changes in DRAM average selling prices have ranged from plus mid-30s percent range to a minus high-40s percent range. Since 2017, annual percentage changes in NAND average selling prices have ranged from nearly flat to a minus low-50s percent range. In recent periods, average selling prices for our products have been below our manufacturing costs and we may experience such circumstances in the future. Average selling prices for our products that decline faster than our costs have recently had an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and in future periods could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Our gross margins may be adversely affected by a range of factors. Our gross margins are dependent, in part, upon continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes and product designs. Factors that may limit our ability to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to prevent deterioration of or improve gross margins include, but are not limited to: • strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix; • increasing complexity of manufacturing processes; • difficulties in transitioning to smaller line-width process technologies or additional 3D memory layers or NAND cell levels; • process complexity including number of mask layers and fabrication steps; • manufacturing yield; • technological barriers; • changes in process technologies; • new products that may require relatively larger die sizes; • start-up or other costs associated with capacity expansions; • higher costs of goods and services due to inflationary pressures or market conditions; and • higher manufacturing costs per gigabit due to fabrication facility underutilization, lower wafer output, and insufficient volume to run new technology nodes to achieve cost optimization. Many factors may result in a reduction of our output or a delay in ramping production, which could lead to underutilization of our production assets. These factors may include, among others, a weak demand environment, industry oversupply, inventory surpluses, difficulties in ramping emerging technologies, supply chain disruptions, and delays from equipment suppliers. See “Part I. Financial Information – Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Overview – Industry Conditions” for information regarding our recent underutilization charges. A significant portion of our manufacturing costs are fixed and do not vary proportionally with changes in production output. As a result, lower utilization, lower wafer output, and corresponding increases in our per gigabit manufacturing costs have resulted in higher inventory carrying costs, and have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our gross margins, business, results of operations, or financial condition. 40 Table of Contents We have a broad portfolio of products to address our customers’ needs, which span multiple market segments and are subject to rapid technological changes. Our manufacturing costs on a per gigabit basis vary across our portfolio as they are largely influenced by the technology node in which the solution was developed. We strive to balance our demand and supply for each technology node, but the dynamics of our markets and our customers can create periods of imbalance, which can lead us to carry elevated inventory levels. Consequently, we may incur charges in connection with obsolete or excess inventories, or we may not fully recover our costs, which would reduce our gross margins. For example, in 2023, we recorded aggregate charges of $1.83 billion to write down the carrying value of our inventories to their estimated net realizable value. In addition, due to the customized nature of certain products we manufacture, we may be unable to sell certain finished goods inventories to alternative customers or manufacture in-process inventory to different specifications, which may result in excess and obsolescence charges in future periods. In addition, if we are unable to supply products that meet customer design and performance specifications, we may be required to sell such products at lower average selling prices, which may reduce our gross margins. Our gross margins may also be impacted by shifts in product mix, driven by our strategy to optimize our portfolio to best respond to changing market dynamics. Our inability to prevent deterioration of or improve gross margins could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. We face geopolitical and other risks associated with our international operations that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. In addition to our U.S. operations, a substantial portion of our operations are conducted in Taiwan, Singapore, Japan, Malaysia, China, and India, and many of our customers, suppliers, and vendors also operate internationally. In 2023, nearly half of our revenue was from sales to customers who have headquarters located outside the United States, while over 80% of our revenue in 2023 was from products shipped to customer locations outside the United States. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks, including: • restrictions on sales of goods or services to one or more of our significant foreign customers; • export and import duties, changes to import and export regulations, customs regulations and processes, and restrictions on the transfer of funds, including currency controls in China, which could negatively affect the amount and timing of payments from certain of our customers and, as a result, our cash flows; • compliance with U.S. and international laws involving international operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, sanctions and anti-corruption laws, export and import laws, and similar rules and regulations; • theft of intellectual property; • political and economic instability, including instability resulting from domestic and international conflicts; • government actions or civil unrest preventing the flow of products and materials, including delays in shipping and obtaining products and materials, cancellation of orders, or loss or damage of products; • problems with the transportation or delivery of products and materials; • issues arising from cultural or language differences and labor unrest; • longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; • compliance with trade, technical standards, and other laws in a variety of jurisdictions; • contractual and regulatory limitations on the ability to maintain flexibility with staffing levels; • disruptions to manufacturing or R&D activities as a result of actions imposed by foreign governments; • changes in economic policies of foreign governments; • difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and • public health issues. If we or our customers, suppliers, or vendors are impacted by any of these risks, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 41 | 2024 Q3 10-Q Table of Contents Following the May 21, 2023 decision of its cybersecurity review of our products sold in China, the CAC determined that critical information infrastructure operators in China may not purchase Micron products, impacting our revenue with companies headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong, including direct sales as well as indirect sales through distributors. Some revenue with customers headquartered outside of China has also been impacted. Further actions by the Chinese government could impact additional revenue inside or outside China, or our operations in China, or our ability to ship products to our customers, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Political, economic, or other actions may adversely affect our operations in Taiwan. A majority of our DRAM production output in 2023 was from our fabrication facilities in Taiwan and any loss of output could have a material adverse effect on us. Any political, economic, or other actions may also adversely affect our customers and the technology industry supply chain, for which Taiwan is a central hub, and as a result, could have a material adverse impact on us. In addition, the U.S. government has in the past restricted American firms from selling products and software to certain of our customers and may in the future impose similar restrictions on one or more of our significant customers. These restrictions may not prohibit our competitors from selling similar products to our customers, which may result in our loss of sales and market share. Even as such restrictions are lifted, financial or other penalties or continuing export restrictions imposed with respect to our customers could have a continuing negative impact on our future revenue and results of operations, and we may not be able to recover any customers or market share we lose, or make such recoveries at acceptable average selling prices, while complying with such restrictions. The semiconductor memory and storage markets are highly competitive. We face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets from a number of companies, including Kioxia Holdings Corporation; Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.; SK hynix Inc.; and Western Digital Corporation. Our competitors may use aggressive pricing to obtain market share. Some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have a larger market share and greater resources to invest in technology, capitalize on growth opportunities, and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete. Consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage as our competitors may benefit from increased manufacturing scale and a stronger product portfolio. We operate in different jurisdictions than our competitors and may be impacted by unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. In addition, some governments may provide, or have provided and may continue to provide, significant assistance, financial or otherwise, to some of our competitors or to new entrants and may intervene in support of national industries and/or competitors. In particular, we face the threat of increasing competition as a result of significant investment in the semiconductor industry by the Chinese government and various state-owned or affiliated entities, in companies such as Yangtze Memory Technologies Co., Ltd. (“YMTC”) and ChangXin Memory Technologies, Inc. (“CXMT”). In addition, the CAC’s decision that critical information infrastructure operators in China may not purchase Micron products had an impact on our ability to compete effectively in China and elsewhere. We and our competitors generally seek to increase supply to address growing market demands, improve yields, and reduce die size, which could result in significant increases in worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices. Increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage also result from fabrication capacity expansions, either by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization, or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory and storage production. Our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply. We, and some of our competitors, have plans to ramp, or are constructing or ramping, production at new fabrication facilities. Increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage, if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand, could lead to declines in average selling prices for our products and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. If competitors are more successful at developing or implementing new product or process technology, their products could have cost or performance advantages. The competitive nature of our industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 42 Table of Contents Our future success depends on our ability to develop and produce new and competitive memory and storage technologies and products. Our key semiconductor memory and storage technologies face technological barriers to continue to meet long-term customer needs. These barriers include potential limitations on stacking additional 3D memory layers, increasing bits per cell (i.e., cell levels), meeting higher density requirements, developing advanced packaging solutions, improving power consumption and reliability, and delivering advanced features and higher performance. We may face technological barriers to continue to shrink our products at our current or historical rate, which has generally reduced per gigabit cost. We have invested and expect to continue to invest in R&D for new and existing products and process technologies, such as EUV lithography, to continue to deliver advanced product requirements. Such new technologies can add complexity and risk to our schedule and may affect our costs and production output. We may be unable to recover our investment in R&D or otherwise realize the economic benefits of reducing die size or increasing memory and storage densities. Our competitors are working to develop new memory and storage technologies that may offer performance and/or cost advantages to existing technologies and render existing technologies obsolete. Accordingly, our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce viable and competitive new memory and storage technologies. We are developing new products, including system-level memory and storage products and solutions, which complement our traditional products or leverage their underlying design or process technology. We have invested and expect to continue to invest in new semiconductor product and system-level solution development. We are increasingly differentiating our products and solutions to meet the specific demands of our customers, which increases our reliance on our customers’ ability to accurately forecast the needs and preferences of their customers. As a result, our product demand forecasts may be impacted significantly by the strategic actions of our customers. In addition, our ability to successfully introduce new products often requires us to make product specification decisions multiple years in advance of when new products enter the market. It is important that we deliver products in a timely manner with increasingly advanced performance characteristics at the time our customers are designing and evaluating samples for their products. If we do not meet their product design schedules, our customers may exclude us from further consideration as a supplier for those products. The process to develop new products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality, performance, and reliability, often well in advance of a planned ramp of production, in order to secure design wins with our customers. Many factors may negatively impact our ability to meet anticipated timelines and/or expected or required quality standards with respect to the development of certain of our products. In addition, some of our components have long lead-times, requiring us to place orders up to a year in advance of anticipated demand. Such long lead-times increase the risk of excess inventory or loss of sales in the event our forecasts vary substantially from actual demand. There can be no assurance of the following: • we will be successful in developing competitive new semiconductor memory and storage technologies and products; • we will be able to cost-effectively manufacture new products; • we will be able to successfully market these technologies; • margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts; • we will be able to establish or maintain key relationships with customers, or that we will not be prohibited from working with certain customers, for specific chip set or design requirements; • we will accurately predict and design products that meet our customers' specifications; or • we will be able to introduce new products into the market and qualify them with our customers on a timely basis. Unsuccessful efforts to develop new memory and storage technologies and products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 43 | 2024 Q3 10-Q Table of Contents We may not be able to achieve expected returns from capacity expansions. We have announced our intent to expand our production capacity and/or make capital investments in the United States and in other regions where we operate. These expansions involve several risks including the following: • capital expenditure requirements for capacity expansions during periods of relatively low free cash flow generation, resulting from challenging memory and storage industry conditions; • availability of necessary funding, which may include external sources; • ability to realize expected grants, investment tax credits, and other government incentives, including through the CHIPS Act and other national, international, state, and local grants; • potential changes in laws or provisions of grants, investment tax credits, and other government incentives; • potential restrictions or delays related to environmental regulations or permits; • potential restrictions on expanding in certain geographies; • availability of equipment and construction materials; • ability to complete construction as scheduled and within budget; • availability of the necessary workforce; • ability to timely ramp production in a cost-effective manner; • increases to our cost structure until new production is ramped to adequate scale; and • sufficient customer demand to utilize our increased capacity. We invest our capital in areas that we believe best align with our business strategy and optimize future returns. Investments in capital expenditures may not generate expected returns or cash flows. Significant judgment is required to determine which capital investments will result in optimal returns, and we could invest in projects that are ultimately less profitable than those projects we do not select. Delays in completion and ramping of new production facilities, or failure to optimize our investment choices, could significantly impact our ability to realize expected returns on our capital expenditures. Any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Our incentives from various governments are conditional upon achieving or maintaining certain outcomes or compliance with other obligations and are subject to reduction, termination, clawback, or could impose certain limitations on our business. We have received, and may in the future continue to receive, benefits and incentives from national, state, and local governments in various regions of the world designed to encourage us to establish, maintain, or increase investment, workforce, research and development, or production in those regions. These incentives may take various forms, including grants, subsidies, loans, and tax arrangements, and typically require us to achieve or maintain certain levels of investment, capital spending, employment, technology deployment or development milestones, construction or production milestones, or research and development activities to qualify for such incentives or could restrict us from undertaking certain activities. We may be unable to obtain sufficient future incentives to continue to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and operating costs, without which our cost structure may be adversely impacted and planned capital expenditures and research and development expenditures may be affected. We also cannot guarantee that we will successfully achieve and maintain outcomes or be able to comply with other obligations required to qualify for these incentives or that the granting agencies will provide or continue to provide such funding. These incentive arrangements typically provide the granting agencies with rights to audit our compliance with their terms and obligations. Such audits could result in modifications to, or termination of, the applicable incentive program. The incentives we receive could be subject to reduction, termination, or clawback, and any decrease or clawback of government incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 44 Table of Contents Our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be adversely affected by the availability and quality of materials, supplies, and capital equipment, or dependency on third-party service providers. Our supply chain and operations are dependent on the availability of materials that meet exacting standards and the use of third parties to provide us with components and services. We generally have multiple sources of supply for our materials and services. However, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain materials, components, and services that meet our standards and, in some cases, materials, components, or services are provided by a single or sole source, and we may be unable to qualify new suppliers on a timely basis. The availability of materials or components such as chemicals, silicon wafers, gases, photoresist, controllers, substrates, lead frames, printed circuit boards, targets, and reticle glass blanks is impacted by various factors. These factors could include a shortage of raw materials or a disruption in the processing or purification of those raw materials into finished goods. Shortages or increases in lead times have occurred in the past, are currently occurring with respect to some materials and components, and may occur from time to time in the future. Constraints within our supply chain for certain materials and integrated circuit components could limit our bit shipments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Our manufacturing processes are also dependent on our relationships with third-party manufacturers of controllers, analog integrated circuits, and other components used in some of our products and with outsourced semiconductor foundries, assembly and test providers, contract manufacturers, logistics carriers, and other service providers, including providers of maintenance for our advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment and providers of electricity and other utilities. Although we have certain long-term contracts with some of our suppliers, many of these contracts do not provide for long-term capacity or pricing commitments. To the extent we do not have firm commitments from our third-party suppliers over a specific time period or for any specific capacity, quantity, and/or pricing, our suppliers may allocate capacity to their other customers and capacity and/or materials may not be available when needed or at reasonable prices. Inflationary pressures have increased, and may continue to increase costs for materials, supplies, and services. Regardless of contract structure, large swings in demand may exceed our contracted supply and/or our suppliers’ capacity to meet those demand changes resulting in a shortage of parts, materials, or capacity needed to manufacture our products. In addition, if any of our suppliers were to cease operations or become insolvent, this could impact their ability to provide us with necessary supplies, and we may not be able to obtain the needed supply in a timely way or at all from other providers. Certain materials are primarily available in a limited number of countries, including rare earth elements, minerals, and metals. Trade disputes, geopolitical tensions, economic circumstances, political conditions, or public health issues may limit our ability to obtain such materials. Although these rare earth and other materials are generally available from multiple suppliers, China is the predominant producer of certain of these materials. If China were to restrict or stop exporting these materials, our suppliers’ ability to obtain such supply may be constrained and we may be unable to obtain sufficient quantities, or obtain supply in a timely manner, or at a commercially reasonable cost. Constrained supply of rare earth elements, minerals, and metals may restrict our ability to manufacture certain of our products and make it difficult or impossible to compete with other semiconductor memory and storage manufacturers who are able to obtain sufficient quantities of these materials from China. We and/or our suppliers and service providers could be affected by regional conflicts, civil unrest, labor disruptions, sanctions, tariffs, embargoes, or other trade restrictions, as well as laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change, conflict minerals, responsible sourcing practices, public health crises, or other matters, which could limit the supply of our materials and/or increase the cost. Environmental regulations could limit our ability to procure or use certain chemicals or materials in our operations or products. In addition, disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of materials. Our ability to procure components to repair equipment essential for our manufacturing processes could also be negatively impacted by various restrictions or disruptions in supply chains, among other items. The disruption of our supply of materials, components, or services, or the extension of our lead times could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 45 | 2024 Q3 10-Q Table of Contents Our operations are dependent on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment that enables the transition to lower cost manufacturing processes. For certain key types of equipment, including photolithography tools, we are sometimes dependent on a single supplier. From time to time, we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to suppliers’ limited capacity. Our inability to obtain equipment on a timely basis could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing processes and reduce our costs. Delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production and could increase our overall costs of a ramp. Our inability to obtain advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Our construction projects to expand production and R&D capacity are highly dependent on available sources of labor, materials, equipment, and services. Increasing demand, supply constraints, inflation, and other market conditions could result in increasing shortages and higher costs for these items. Difficulties in obtaining these resources could result in significant delays in completion of our construction projects and cost increases, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Our inability to source materials, supplies, capital equipment, or third-party services could affect our overall production output and our ability to fulfill customer demand. Significant or prolonged shortages of our products could halt customer manufacturing and damage our relationships with these customers. Any damage to our customer relationships as a result of a shortage of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Similarly, if our customers experience disruptions to their supplies, materials, components, or services, or the extension of their lead times, they may reduce, cancel, or alter the timing of their purchases with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Downturns in regional or worldwide economies may harm our business. Downturns in regional or worldwide economies, due to inflation, geopolitics, major central bank policy actions including interest rate increases, public health crises, or other factors, have harmed our business in the past and current and future downturns could also adversely affect our business. Adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that incorporate our products, such as personal computers, smartphones, automobiles, and servers. Reduced demand for these or other products could result in significant decreases in our average selling prices and product sales. In addition, to the extent our customers or distributors have elevated inventory levels or are impacted by a deterioration in credit markets, we may experience a decrease in short-term and/or long-term demand resulting in industry oversupply and declines in pricing for our products. A deterioration of conditions in regional or worldwide credit markets could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures. In addition, we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties. Difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivable due to credit defaults. As a result, downturns in regional or worldwide economies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. If our manufacturing process is disrupted by operational issues, natural disasters, or other events, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. We and our subcontractors manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance. Difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs. We and our subcontractors maintain operations and continuously implement new product and process technology at manufacturing facilities, which are widely dispersed in multiple locations in several countries including the United States, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, Malaysia, and China. As a result of the necessary interdependence within our network of manufacturing facilities, an operational disruption at one of our or a subcontractor’s facilities may have a disproportionate impact on our ability to produce many of our products. 46 Table of Contents From time to time, there have been disruptions in our manufacturing operations as a result of power outages, improperly functioning equipment, disruptions in supply of raw materials or components, or equipment failures. We have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences and possible climate changes, such as severe and variable weather and geological events resulting in increased costs, or disruptions to our manufacturing operations or those of our suppliers or customers. In addition, climate change may pose physical risks to our manufacturing facilities or our suppliers’ facilities, including increased extreme weather events that could result in supply delays or disruptions. Other events, including political or public health crises, such as an outbreak of contagious diseases, may also affect our production capabilities or that of our suppliers, including as a result of quarantines, closures of production facilities, lack of supplies, or delays caused by restrictions on travel or shipping. Events of the types noted above have occurred from time to time and may occur in the future. As a result, in addition to disruptions to operations, our insurance premiums may increase or we may not be able to fully recover any sustained losses through insurance. If production is disrupted for any reason, manufacturing yields may be adversely affected, or we may be unable to meet our customers’ requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers. This could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs, loss of revenue, or damage to customer relationships, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. A significant portion of our revenue is concentrated with a select number of customers. Approximately one-half of our total revenue comes from our top ten customers. A disruption in our relationship with any of these customers could adversely affect our business. We could experience fluctuations in our customer base or the mix of revenue by customer as markets and strategies evolve. Our customers’ demand for our products may fluctuate due to factors beyond our control. In addition, any consolidation of our customers could reduce the number of customers to whom our products may be sold. Our inability to meet our customers’ requirements or to qualify our products with them could adversely impact our revenue. A meaningful change in the inventory strategy of our customers could impact our industry bit demand growth outlook. The loss of, or restrictions on our ability to sell to, one or more of our major customers, or any significant reduction in orders from, or a shift in product mix by, customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Increases in sales of system solutions may increase our dependency upon specific customers and our costs to develop, qualify, and manufacture our system solutions. Our development of system-level memory and storage products is dependent, in part, upon successfully identifying and meeting our customers’ specifications for those products. Developing and manufacturing system-level products with specifications unique to a customer increases our reliance upon that customer for purchasing our products at sufficient volumes and prices in a timely manner. Even if our products meet customer specifications, our sales of system-level solutions are dependent upon our customers choosing our products over those of our competitors and purchasing our products at sufficient volumes and prices. Our competitors’ products may be less costly, provide better performance, or include additional features when compared to our products. Our long-term ability to sell system-level memory and storage products is reliant upon our customers’ ability to create, market, and sell their products containing our system-level solutions at sufficient volumes and prices in a timely manner. If we fail to successfully develop and market system-level products, our business, results of operations, or financial condition may be materially adversely affected. Manufacturing system-level solutions, such as SSDs, managed NAND, and HBM, typically results in higher per-unit manufacturing costs as compared to other products. Even if we are successful in selling system-level solutions to our customers in sufficient volume, we may be unable to generate sufficient profit if our per-unit manufacturing costs are not offset by higher per-unit selling prices. Manufacturing system-level solutions to customer specifications requires a longer development cycle, as compared to discrete products, to design, test, and qualify, which may increase our costs. Some of our system solutions are increasingly dependent on sophisticated firmware that may require significant customization to meet customer specifications, which increases our costs and time to market. Additionally, we may need to update our controller and hardware design as well as our firmware or develop new firmware as a result of new product introductions or changes in customer specifications and/or industry standards, which increases our costs. System complexities and extended warranties for system-level products could also increase our warranty costs. Our failure to cost-effectively manufacture system-level solutions and/or controller, hardware design, and firmware in a timely manner may result in reduced demand for our system-level products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 47 | 2024 Q3 10-Q Table of Contents Products that fail to meet specifications, are defective, or are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us. Products that do not meet specifications or that contain, or are perceived by our customers to contain, defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. From time to time, we experience problems with nonconforming, defective, or incompatible products after we have shipped such products. In recent periods, we have further diversified and expanded our product offerings, which could potentially increase the chance that one or more of our products could fail to meet specifications in a particular application. Our products and solutions may be deemed fully or partially responsible for functionality in our customers’ products and may result in sharing or shifting of product or financial liability from our customers to us for costs incurred by the end user as a result of our customers’ products failing to perform as specified. In addition, if our products and solutions perform critical functions in our customers’ products or are used in high-risk consumer end products, such as autonomous driver assistance programs, home and enterprise security, smoke and noxious gas detectors, medical monitoring equipment, or wearables for child and elderly safety, our potential liability may increase. We could be adversely affected in several ways, including the following: • we may be required or agree to compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible products and to replace products; • we could incur a decrease in revenue or adjustment to pricing commensurate with the reimbursement of such costs or alleged damages; and • we may encounter adverse publicity, which could cause a decrease in sales of our products or harm our reputation or relationships with existing or potential customers. Any of the foregoing items could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Breaches of our security systems or products, or those of our customers, suppliers, or business partners, could expose us to losses. We maintain a system of controls over the physical security of our facilities. We also manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations. In addition, we process, store, and transmit large amounts of data relating to our customers and employees, including sensitive personal information. Unauthorized persons, employees, former employees, nation states, or other parties may gain access to our facilities or technology infrastructure and systems through fraudulent means to steal trade secrets or other proprietary information, compromise confidential information, create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. This risk is exacerbated as competitors for talent, particularly engineering talent, attempt to hire our employees. Through cyberattacks on technology infrastructure and systems, unauthorized parties may obtain access to computer systems, networks, and data, including cloud-based platforms. The technology infrastructure and systems of our suppliers, vendors, service providers, cloud solution providers, and partners have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, such attacks, which could impact our operations. Cyberattacks can include ransomware, computer denial-of-service attacks, worms, supply chain attacks, social engineering, open source vulnerabilities, and other malicious software programs or other attacks, including those using techniques that change frequently or may be disguised or difficult to detect, or designed to remain dormant until a triggering event, impersonation of authorized users, and efforts to discover and exploit any design flaws, “bugs,” security vulnerabilities, as well as intentional or unintentional acts by employees or other insiders with access privileges. Additionally, some actors are using artificial intelligence technology to launch more automated, targeted, and coordinated attacks. Globally, cyberattacks are increasing in number and the attackers are increasingly organized and well-financed, or supported by state actors, and are developing increasingly sophisticated systems to not only attack, but also to evade detection. In addition, geopolitical tensions or conflicts may create a heightened risk of cyberattacks. Breaches of our physical security, attacks on our technology infrastructure and systems, or breaches or attacks on our customers, suppliers, or business partners who have confidential or sensitive information regarding us and our customers and suppliers, could result in significant losses and damage our reputation with customers and suppliers and may expose us to litigation if the confidential information of our customers, suppliers, or employees is compromised. 48 Table of Contents Our products are also targets for cyberattacks, including those products utilized in cloud-based environments. While some of our products contain encryption or security algorithms designed to protect third-party content or user-generated data stored on our products, these products could still be hacked or the encryption schemes could be compromised, breached, or circumvented by motivated and sophisticated attackers. Further, our products contain sophisticated hardware and firmware and applications that may contain security vulnerabilities or defects in design or manufacture, including “bugs” and other problems that could interfere with the intended operation of our products. To the extent our products are hacked, encryption schemes are compromised, or our suppliers are breached or attacked, this could harm our business by requiring us to employ additional resources to fix the errors or defects, exposing us to litigation, claims, and harm to our reputation. Additionally, we cannot be certain that any applicable insurance coverage we maintain will be adequate or otherwise protect us with respect to claims, expenses, fines, penalties, business loss, data loss, litigation, regulatory actions, or other impacts arising from security breaches or incidents, or that such coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or at all. Any of the foregoing security risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. We must attract, retain, and motivate highly skilled employees. To remain competitive, we must attract, retain, and motivate executives and a highly skilled, diverse workforce, as well as effectively manage succession for key roles. Competition for experienced employees in our industry can be intense. Hiring and retaining qualified executives and other skilled talent is critical to our business. If our total compensation programs, employment benefits, and workplace culture are not viewed as competitive and inclusive, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees could be compromised. At times, we experience higher levels of attrition, increasing compensation costs, and more intense competition for talent across our industry. To the extent we experience significant attrition and are unable to timely replace employees, we could experience a loss of critical skills and reduced employee morale, potentially resulting in business disruptions or increased expenses to address any disruptions. Additionally, changes to immigration policies in the countries in which we operate, as well as restrictions on travel due to public health crises or other causes, may limit our ability to hire and/or retain talent in, or transfer talent to, specific locations. Our inability to attract, retain, and motivate executives and other employees or effectively manage succession of key roles may inhibit our ability to maintain or expand our business operations. Compliance with responsible sourcing requirements and any related regulations could increase our operating costs, or limit the supply and increase the cost of certain materials, supplies, and services, and if we fail to comply, customers may reduce purchases from us or disqualify us as a supplier. We and many of our customers have adopted responsible sourcing programs that require us to meet certain environmental, social, and governance criteria, and to periodically report on our performance against these requirements, including that we source the materials, supplies, and services we use and incorporate into the products we sell as prescribed by these programs. Many customer programs require us to remove a supplier within a prescribed period if such supplier ceases to comply with prescribed criteria, and our supply chain may at any time contain suppliers at risk of being removed due to non-compliance with responsible sourcing requirements. Some of our customers may elect to disqualify us as a supplier (resulting in a permanent or temporary loss of sales to such customer) or reduce purchases from us if we are unable to verify that our performance or products (including the underlying supply chain) meet the specifications of our customers’ responsible sourcing programs on a continuous basis. Meeting responsible sourcing requirements may increase operating requirements and costs or limit the sourcing and availability of some of the materials, supplies, and services we use, particularly when the availability of such materials, supplies, and services is concentrated to a limited number of suppliers. From time to time, we remove suppliers or require our suppliers to remove suppliers from their supply chains based on our responsible sourcing requirements or customer requirements, and we or our suppliers may be unable to replace such removed suppliers in a timely or cost-effective manner. Any inability to replace removed suppliers in a timely or cost effective manner may affect our ability and/or the cost to obtain sufficient quantities of materials, supplies, and services necessary for the manufacture of our products. Our inability to replace suppliers we have removed in a timely or cost-effective manner or comply with customers’ responsible sourcing requirements or with any related regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 49 | 2024 Q3 10-Q Table of Contents Failure to meet environmental, social, and governance expectations or standards or achieve our related goals could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or stock price. In recent years, there has been an increased focus from stakeholders on environmental, social, and governance matters, including greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related risks, sustainability, renewable energy, water stewardship, waste management, diversity, equality and inclusion, responsible sourcing and supply chain, human rights, and social responsibility. Given our commitment to social and environmental issues as it relates to our business, we actively manage these issues and have established and publicly announced certain goals, commitments, and targets which we may refine or even expand further in the future. These goals, commitments, and targets reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. Achieving these goals may entail significant costs, for example we have entered into several virtual power purchase agreements to obtain renewable energy credits at a cost that will vary based on future prices for electrical power. Evolving stakeholder expectations and our efforts to manage these issues, report on them, and accomplish our goals present numerous operational, regulatory, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks, any of which could have a material adverse impact, including on our reputation and stock price. Such risks and uncertainties include: • reputational harm, including damage to our relationships with customers, suppliers, investors, governments, or other stakeholders; • adverse impacts on our ability to manufacture and sell products and maintain our market share; • the success of our collaborations with third parties; • increased risk of litigation, investigations, or regulatory enforcement action; • unfavorable environmental, social, and governance ratings or investor sentiment; • diversion of resources and increased costs to control, assess, and report on environmental, social, and governance metrics; • our ability to achieve our goals, commitments, and targets within timeframes announced; • increased costs to achieve our goals, commitments, and targets; • unforeseen operational and technological difficulties; • access to and increased cost of capital; and • adverse impacts on our stock price. Any failure, or perceived failure, to meet evolving stakeholder expectations and industry standards or achieve our environmental, social, and governance goals, commitments, and targets could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or stock price. Acquisitions and/or alliances involve numerous risks. Acquisitions and the formation or operation of alliances, such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements, involve numerous risks, including the following: • integrating the operations, technologies, and products of acquired or newly formed entities into our operations; • increasing capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain facilities; • increased debt levels; • the assumption of unknown or underestimated liabilities; • the use of cash to finance a transaction, which may reduce the availability of cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures, R&D expenditures, and other business activities; • diverting management’s attention from daily operations; • managing larger or more complex operations and facilities and employees in separate and diverse geographic areas; • hiring and retaining key employees; • requirements imposed by government authorities in connection with the regulatory review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures or restrictions on the conduct of our business or the acquired business; • underestimating the costs or overestimating the benefits, including product, revenue, cost and other synergies and growth opportunities that we expect to realize, and we may not achieve those benefits; • failure to maintain customer, vendor, and other relationships; 50 Table of Contents • inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company’s internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, compliance programs, and/or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices; and • impairment of acquired intangible assets, goodwill, or other assets as a result of changing business conditions or technological advancements. The global memory and storage industry has experienced consolidation and may continue to consolidate. We engage, from time to time, in discussions regarding potential acquisitions and similar opportunities. To the extent we are successful in completing any such transactions, we could be subject to some or all of the risks described above. Acquisitions of, or alliances with, technology companies are inherently risky and may not be successful and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. We have incurred restructure charges and may incur restructure charges in future periods and may not realize expected savings or other benefits from restructure plans. In 2023, we initiated a restructure plan in response to challenging industry conditions (the “2023 Restructure Plan”). Under the 2023 Restructure Plan, we reduced our headcount by approximately 15% through a combination of voluntary attrition and personnel reductions. The 2023 Restructure Plan was substantially completed in 2023. In addition, we may in the future enter into other restructure initiatives in order to, among other items, streamline our operations, respond to changes in business conditions, our markets, or product offerings, or to centralize certain key functions. We may not realize expected savings or other benefits from our 2023 Restructure Plan or future restructure activities and may incur additional restructure charges or other losses in future periods associated with other initiatives. In connection with any restructure initiatives, we could incur restructure charges, loss of production output, loss of key personnel, disruptions in our operations, and difficulties in the timely delivery of products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Risks Related to Intellectual Property and Litigation We may be unable to protect our intellectual property or retain key employees who are knowledgeable of and develop our intellectual property. We maintain a system of controls over our intellectual property, including U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, licensing arrangements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with employees, consultants, and vendors, and a general system of internal controls. Despite our system of controls over our intellectual property, it may be possible for our current or future competitors to obtain, copy, use, or disclose, illegally or otherwise, our product and process technology or other proprietary information. The laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same degree as do U.S. laws, and our confidentiality, non-disclosure, and non-compete agreements may be unenforceable or difficult and costly to enforce. Additionally, our ability to maintain and develop intellectual property is dependent upon our ability to attract, develop, and retain highly skilled employees. If our competitors or future entrants into our industry are successful in hiring our employees, they may directly benefit from the knowledge these employees gained while they were under our employment, and this may also negatively impact our ability to maintain and develop intellectual property. Our inability to protect our intellectual property or retain key employees who are knowledgeable of and develop our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Legal proceedings and claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. From time to time, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business or otherwise, both domestically and internationally. Such claims include, but are not limited to, allegations of anticompetitive conduct and infringement of intellectual property. See “Part I. Financial Information – Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Contingencies.” 51 | 2024 Q3 10-Q Table of Contents Any claim, with or without merit, could result in significant legal fees that could negatively impact our financial results, disrupt our operations, and require significant attention from our management. We may be associated with and subject to litigation, claims, or arbitration disputes arising from, or as a result of: • our relationships with vendors or customers, supply agreements, or contractual obligations with our subcontractors or business partners; • the actions of our vendors, subcontractors, or business partners; • our indemnification obligations, including obligations to defend our customers against third-party claims asserting infringement of certain intellectual property rights, which may include patents, trademarks, copyrights, or trade secrets; and • the terms of our product warranties or from product liability claims. As we continue to focus on developing system solutions with manufacturers of consumer products, including autonomous driving, augmented reality, and others, we may be exposed to greater potential for personal liability claims against us as a result of consumers’ use of those products. We, our officers, or our directors could also be subject to claims of alleged violations of securities laws. There can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities, and we may elect to self-insure with respect to certain matters. Exposures to various legal proceedings and claims could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend claims, are required to pay damage awards, or enter into settlement agreements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Claims that our products or manufacturing processes infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others, or failure to obtain or renew license agreements covering such intellectual property, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. As is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries, from time to time others have asserted, and may in the future assert, that our products or manufacturing processes infringe upon, misappropriate, misuse, or otherwise violate their intellectual property rights. We are unable to predict the outcome of these assertions made against us. Any of these types of claims, regardless of the merits, could subject us to significant costs to defend or resolve such claims and may consume a substantial portion of management’s time and attention. As a result of these claims, we may be required to: • pay significant monetary damages, fines, royalties, or penalties; • enter into license or settlement agreements covering such intellectual property rights; • make material changes to or redesign our products and/or manufacturing processes; and/or • cease manufacturing, having made, selling, offering for sale, importing, marketing, or using products and/or manufacturing processes in certain jurisdictions. We may not be able to take any of the actions described above on commercially reasonable terms and any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. See “Part I. Financial Information – Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Contingencies.” We have a number of intellectual property license agreements. Some of these license agreements require us to make one-time or periodic payments. We may need to obtain additional licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future. We are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on terms acceptable to us. The failure to obtain or renew licenses as necessary could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 52 Table of Contents Risks Related to Laws and Regulations Government actions and regulations, such as export restrictions, tariffs, and trade protection measures, may limit our ability to sell our products to certain customers or markets, or could otherwise restrict our ability to conduct operations. International trade disputes, geopolitical tensions, and military conflicts have led, and continue to lead, to new and increasing export restrictions, trade barriers, tariffs, and other trade measures that can increase our manufacturing costs, make our products less competitive, reduce demand for our products, limit our ability to sell to certain customers or markets, limit our ability to procure, or increase our costs for, components or raw materials, impede or slow the movement of our goods across borders, impede our ability to perform R&D activities, or otherwise restrict our ability to conduct operations. Increasing protectionism, economic nationalism, and national security concerns may lead to further changes in trade policy, domestic sourcing initiatives, or other formal and informal measures that could make it more difficult to sell our products in, or restrict our access to, some markets and/or customers. For example, following the May 21, 2023 decision of its cybersecurity review of our products sold in China, the CAC determined that critical information infrastructure operators in China may not purchase Micron products, impacting our revenue with companies headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong, including direct sales as well as indirect sales through distributors. Some revenue with customers headquartered outside of China has also been impacted. Further actions by the Chinese government could impact additional revenue inside or outside China, or our operations in China, or our ability to ship products to our customers, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. We cannot predict what further actions may ultimately be taken with respect to export regulations, tariffs, or other trade regulations between the United States and other countries, what products or companies may be subject to such actions, or what actions may be taken by other countries in retaliation. Further changes in trade policy, tariffs, restrictions on exports or other trade barriers, or restrictions on supplies, equipment, and raw materials including rare earth minerals, may limit our ability to produce products, increase our selling and/or manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies. Such changes may also result in reputational harm to us, the development or adoption of technologies that compete with our products, long-term changes in global trade and technology supply chains, or negative impacts on our customers’ products which incorporate our solutions. Any of the effects described in this risk factor could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. The technology industry is subject to intense media, political, and regulatory scrutiny, which can increase our exposure to government investigations, legal actions, and penalties. Although we have policies, controls, and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, or agents will not violate such laws or our policies. Violations of trade laws, restrictions, or regulations can result in fines; criminal sanctions against us or our officers, directors, or employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. Tax-related matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes and cash tax liabilities in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including changes in the geographic mix of our earnings among jurisdictions, challenges by tax authorities to our tax positions and intercompany transfer pricing arrangements, failure to meet performance obligations with respect to tax incentive agreements, expanding our operations in various countries, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, adverse resolution of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns, and changes in tax laws and regulations. 53 | 2024 Q3 10-Q Table of Contents Changes to income tax laws and regulations, or the interpretation of such laws, in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could significantly increase our effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flows from operating activities and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Beginning in 2024, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 imposes a 15% book minimum tax on corporations with three-year average annual adjusted financial statement income exceeding $1 billion. The impact of this tax will depend on our facts in each year, anticipated guidance from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and other developing global tax legislation. Further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”). In December 2022, the European Union (“EU”) member states reached an agreement to implement the minimum tax component (“Pillar Two”) of the OECD’s tax reform initiative. The directive has been enacted or will be enacted retroactively to be in effect as of January 1, 2024 in nearly all EU member states. If similar directives under Pillar Two are adopted by taxing authorities in other countries where we do business, such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. We and others are subject to a variety of complex and evolving laws, regulations, or industry standards, including with respect to environmental, health, safety, and product considerations, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. The manufacture of our products requires the use of facilities, equipment, chemicals, and materials that are subject to a broad array of laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions in which we operate. Additionally, we are subject to a variety of other laws and regulations relative to the construction, maintenance, and operations of our facilities. Any changes in laws, regulations, or industry standards could cause us to incur additional direct costs, as well as increased indirect costs related to our relationships with our customers and suppliers, and otherwise harm our operations and financial condition. Any failure to comply with laws, regulations, or industry standards could adversely impact our reputation and our financial results. Additionally, we engage various third parties as sales channel partners or to represent us or otherwise act on our behalf who are also subject to a broad array of laws, regulations, and industry standards. Our engagement with these third parties may also expose us to risks associated with their respective compliance with laws and regulations. New and evolving environmental health, safety, and product considerations, including those related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, the purchase, use and disposal of regulated and/or hazardous chemicals, and the potential resulting environmental, health or safety impacts, may result in new laws, regulations, or industry standards that may affect us, our suppliers, and our customers. Such laws, regulations, or industry standards could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers, or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. New and evolving cybersecurity, data privacy, and artificial intelligence laws and regulations impose requirements for information confidentiality, integrity, availability, personal and proprietary data collection, storage, use, sharing, deletion, and artificial intelligence solutions that must be transparent, fair, secure, human-focused, and accountable. Such laws, standards, and market expectations could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers, or partners reluctance to share information or solutions due to actual or perceived inadequate controls. These costs may adversely impact our operations and financial condition. As a result of the considerations detailed in this risk factor, we could experience the following: • suspension of production or sales of our products; • limited supplies of chemicals or materials used to make our products; • remediation costs; • increased compliance costs; • alteration of our manufacturing processes; • regulatory penalties, fines, civil or criminal sanctions, and other legal liabilities; and • reputational challenges. Compliance with, or our failure, or the failure of our third-party sales channel partners or agents, to comply with, laws, regulations, or industry standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 54 Table of Contents Risks Related to Capitalization and Financial Markets We may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations, make scheduled debt payments, pay our dividend, and make adequate capital investments. Our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory and storage products sold, average selling prices, and manufacturing costs. To develop new product and process technology, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality, we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology, capital equipment, facilities, R&D, and product and process technology. We estimate capital expenditures in 2024 for property, plant, and equipment, net of proceeds from government incentives, to be approximately $8.0 billion. In the past, we have utilized external sources of financing when needed. As a result of our debt levels, expected debt amortization, prevailing interest rates, and general capital market and other economic conditions, it may be difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. We have experienced volatility in our cash flows and operating results and we expect to continue to experience such volatility in the future, which may negatively affect our credit rating. Our credit rating may also be affected by our liquidity, financial results, economic risk, or other factors, which may increase the cost of borrowings and make it difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. There can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows, access capital or credit markets, or find other sources of financing to fund our operations, make debt payments, refinance our debt, pay our quarterly dividend, and make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency. Our inability to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Debt obligations could adversely affect our financial condition. We have incurred in the past, and expect to incur in the future, debt to finance our capital investments, business acquisitions, and to realign our capital structure. As of May 30, 2024, we had debt with a carrying value of $13.26 billion and may incur additional debt, including under our $2.50 billion Revolving Credit Facility. Our debt obligations could adversely impact us as follows: • require us to use a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on debt, which will reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund our business activities; • adversely impact our credit rating, which could increase borrowing costs; • limit our future ability to raise funds for capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, R&D, and other general corporate requirements; • restrict our ability to incur specified indebtedness, create or incur certain liens, and enter into sale-leaseback financing transactions; • increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; • increase our exposure to rising interest rates from variable rate indebtedness; and • result in certain of our debt instruments becoming immediately due and payable or being deemed to be in default if applicable cross default, cross-acceleration and/or similar provisions are triggered. 55 | 2024 Q3 10-Q Table of Contents Our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flows or obtain external financing in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to market, economic, financial, competitive, legislative, and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that additional capital will be available to us, in amounts sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs. Additionally, events and circumstances may occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy applicable draw-down conditions and utilize our Revolving Credit Facility. In light of industry conditions, in 2023, we amended the financial covenants in our Revolving Credit Facility and term loan agreements. See “Part I. Financial Information – Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Overview” and “Part I. Financial Information - Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Debt.” If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows to service our debt payment obligations or satisfy our debt covenants, we may need to refinance, restructure, or amend the terms of our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Across our global operations, significant transactions and balances are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (our reporting currency), primarily the Chinese yuan, euro, Indian rupee, Japanese yen, Malaysian ringgit, New Taiwan dollar, and Singapore dollar. In addition, a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in foreign currencies. Exchange rates for some of these currencies against the U.S. dollar have been volatile and may be volatile in future periods. If these currencies strengthen against the U.S. dollar, our manufacturing costs could significantly increase. Exchange rates for the U.S. dollar that adversely change against our foreign currency exposures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. We are subject to counterparty default risks. We have numerous arrangements with financial institutions that subject us to counterparty default risks, including cash deposits, investments, and derivative instruments. Additionally, we are subject to counterparty default risk from our customers for amounts receivable from them. As a result, we are subject to the risk that the counterparty will default on its performance obligations. A counterparty may not comply with its contractual commitments which could then lead to its defaulting on its obligations with little or no notice to us, which could limit our ability to mitigate our exposure. Additionally, our ability to mitigate our exposures may be constrained by the terms of our contractual arrangements or because market conditions prevent us from taking effective action. If one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterparty’s default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of such default, we could incur significant losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. The trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. Our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, we, the technology industry, and the stock market as a whole have on occasion experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to the specific operating performance of individual companies. The trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely due to various factors, including, but not limited to, actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results, changes in financial forecasts or estimates by us or financial or other market estimates and ratings by securities and other analysts, changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public, interest rate changes, regulatory changes, news regarding our products or products of our competitors, and broad market and industry fluctuations. For these reasons, investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future trading prices of our common stock, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Investors in our common stock may not realize any return on their investment in us and may lose some or all of their investment. Volatility in the trading price of our common stock could also result in the filing of securities class action litigation matters, which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources. 56 Table of Contents The amount and frequency of our share repurchases may fluctuate, and we cannot guarantee that we will fully consummate our share repurchase authorization, or that it will enhance long-term shareholder value. Share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and will diminish our cash reserves. The amount, frequency, and execution of our share repurchases pursuant to our share repurchase authorization may fluctuate based on our operating results, cash flows, and priorities for the use of cash for other purposes. Our expenditures for share repurchases were $425 million in 2023, $2.43 billion in 2022, $1.20 billion in 2021, $176 million in 2020, and $2.66 billion in 2019. These other purposes include, but are not limited to, operational spending, capital spending, acquisitions, and repayment of debt. Other factors, including changes in tax laws, could also impact our share repurchases. Although our Board of Directors has authorized share repurchases of up to $10 billion of our outstanding common stock, the authorization does not obligate us to repurchase any common stock. We cannot guarantee that our share repurchase authorization will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term shareholder value. The repurchase authorization could affect the trading price of our stock and increase volatility, and any announcement of a pause in, or termination of, this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock. In addition, this program will diminish our cash reserves. There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends in any particular amounts or at all. Our Board of Directors has adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which we currently pay a cash dividend on our common shares on a quarterly basis. The declaration and payment of any dividend is subject to the approval of our Board of Directors and our dividend may be discontinued or reduced at any time. There can be no assurance that we will declare cash dividends in the future in any particular amounts, or at all. Future dividends, if any, and their timing and amount, may be affected by, among other factors: our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions, debt service obligations, contractual restrictions, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. A reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock. 57 | 2024 Q3 10-Q Table of Contents ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS In May 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to $10 billion of our outstanding common stock through open-market purchases, block trades, privately-negotiated transactions, derivative transactions, and/or pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date, does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, and is subject to market conditions and our ongoing determination of the best use of available cash. During the quarter ended May 30, 2024, we did not repurchase any common stock under the authorization and as of May 30, 2024, $3.11 billion of the authorization remained available for the repurchase of our common stock. Shares of common stock withheld as payment of withholding taxes upon the vesting of restricted stock are also treated as common stock repurchases. Shares withheld as payment of withholding taxes upon the vesting of restricted stock units are not considered repurchases for purposes of this Item and are not required to be reported.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (All tabular amounts in millions, except per share amounts) (Unaudited) Significant Accounting Policies For a discussion of our significant accounting policies, see “Part II. – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Significant Accounting Policies” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 29, 2024. There have been no changes to our significant accounting policies since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 29, 2024. Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Micron Technology, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) consistent in all material respects with those applied in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 29, 2024. In the opinion of our management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all necessary adjustments, consisting of a normal recurring nature, to fairly state the financial information set forth herein. Our fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period ending on the Thursday closest to August 31. Fiscal years 2025 and 2024 each contain 52 weeks. All period references are to our fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated. These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 29, 2024. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07 (ASC Topic 280), Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures . This ASU expands on existing reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. This ASU will be effective for our annual reporting for 2025 on a retrospective basis. Adoption of this new guidance will result in increased disclosures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 (ASC Topic 740), Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures . This ASU requires disaggregated income tax disclosures on the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. This ASU will be effective for our annual reporting for 2026 on a prospective basis, with retrospective application permitted. Adoption of this new guidance will result in increased disclosures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03 (ASC Topic 220), Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses . This ASU requires disclosure of certain expenses in the notes to the financial statements. This ASU will be effective for our annual reporting for 2028 on a prospective basis, with retrospective application permitted. Adoption of this new guidance will result in increased disclosures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 10 Table of Contents Variable Interest Entities Certain third-party special purpose entities (the \"Lease SPEs\") facilitate equipment lease financing transactions between us and various financial institutions. Neither we nor the financial institutions have an equity interest in the Lease SPEs, which are variable interest entities. The arrangements are financing vehicles and we do not bear any significant risks from variable interests with the Lease SPEs. We do not direct the activities of the Lease SPEs that most significantly impact their economic performance and, as such, we do not consolidate them. As of November 28, 2024, we had approximately $ 1.03 billion of finance lease liabilities and right-of-use assets under these arrangements. Cash and Investments All of our short-term investments and long-term marketable investments were classified as available-for-sale as of the dates noted below. Cash and equivalents and the fair values of our available-for-sale investments, which approximated amortized costs, were as follows: As of November 28, 2024 As of August 29, 2024 Cash and Equivalents Short-term Investments Long-term Marketable Investments (1) Total Fair Value Cash and Equivalents Short-term Investments Long-term Marketable Investments (1) Total Fair Value Cash $ 6,249 $ — $ — $ 6,249 $ 6,654 $ — $ — $ 6,654 Level 1 (2) Money market funds 15 — — 15 20 — — 20 Level 2 (3) Certificates of deposit 354 — — 354 316 6 — 322 Corporate bonds 40 666 671 1,377 — 771 571 1,342 Asset-backed securities 3 31 429 463 — 46 433 479 Government securities 26 63 56 145 35 82 42 159 Commercial paper 6 135 — 141 16 160 — 176 6,693 $ 895 $ 1,156 $ 8,744 7,041 $ 1,065 $ 1,046 $ 9,152 Restricted cash (4) 4 11 Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 6,697 $ 7,052 (1) The maturities of long-term marketable investments primarily range from one to five years , except for asset-backed securities which are not due at a single maturity date. (2) The fair value of Level 1 securities is measured based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. (3) The fair value of Level 2 securities is measured using information obtained from pricing services, which obtain quoted market prices for similar instruments, non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data, or various other methodologies, to determine the appropriate value at the measurement date. We perform supplemental analysis to validate information obtained from these pricing services. No adjustments were made to the fair values indicated by such pricing information as of November 28, 2024 or August 29, 2024. (4) Restricted cash is included in other current assets and primarily relates to certain government incentives received prior to being earned and for which restrictions lapse upon achieving certain performance conditions or which will be returned if performance conditions are not met. Gross realized gains and losses from sales of available-for-sale securities were not significant for any period presented. 11 | 2025 Q1 10-Q Table of Contents Non-marketable Equity Investments In addition to the amounts included in the table above, we had $ 194 million and $ 190 million of non-marketable equity investments without a readily determinable fair value that were included in other noncurrent assets as of November 28, 2024 and August 29, 2024, respectively. For non-marketable investments, we recognized in other non-operating income (expense) a net loss of $ 31 million for the first quarter of 2024. The amount recognized for the first quarter of 2025 was not significant. Our non-marketable equity investments are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis and classified as Level 3.

The resulting variable interest paid is at a rate equal to SOFR plus approximately 3.33 %. The fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges, and as a result, the carrying values of our 2027 Notes reflect adjustments in fair value. Revolving Credit Facility As of November 28, 2024, no amounts were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and $ 2.50 billion was available to us. Under the Revolving Credit Facility, borrowings would generally bear interest at a rate equal to adjusted term SOFR plus 1.00 % to 1.75 %, depending on our corporate credit ratings. Adjusted term SOFR for the Revolving Credit Facility agreement is the SOFR benchmark plus a credit spread adjustment ranging from approximately 0.11 % to 0.43 % depending on the applicable interest period selected. Any amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility would mature in May 2026 and amounts borrowed may be prepaid without penalty. Maturities of Notes Payable and Term Loans As of November 28, 2024, maturities of notes payable and term loans by fiscal year were as follows: Remainder of 2025 $ 80 2026 607 2027 1,780 2028 1,493 2029 700 2030 and thereafter 6,750 Unamortized issuance costs, discounts, and premium, net ( 33 ) Hedge accounting fair value adjustment ( 71 ) $ 11,306 15 | 2025 Q1 10-Q Table of Contents Contingencies We are currently a party to legal actions other than those described below arising from the normal course of business, none of which are expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Patent Matters As is typical in the semiconductor and other high-tech industries, from time to time, others have asserted, and may in the future assert, that our products or manufacturing processes infringe upon their intellectual property rights. A description of certain claims is below. On April 28, 2021, Netlist, Inc. (“Netlist”) filed two patent infringement actions against Micron, Micron Semiconductor Products, Inc. (“MSP”), and Micron Technology Texas, LLC (“MTEC”) in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. The first complaint alleges that one U.S. patent is infringed by certain of our non-volatile dual in-line memory modules. The second complaint alleges that three U.S. patents are infringed by certain of our load-reduced dual in-line memory modules (“LRDIMMs”). Each complaint seeks injunctive relief, damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. On March 31, 2022, Netlist filed a patent infringement complaint against Micron and Micron Semiconductor Germany, GmbH in Dusseldorf Regional Court alleging that two German patents are infringed by certain of our LRDIMMs. The complaint seeks damages, costs, and injunctive relief. In rulings issued on March 7, 2024 and November 7, 2024, the Federal Patent Court in Germany declared both patents invalid. On June 10, 2022, Netlist filed a patent infringement complaint against Micron, MSP, and MTEC in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (“E.D. Tex.”) alleging that six U.S. patents are infringed by certain of our memory modules and HBM products. On August 1, 2022, Netlist filed a second patent infringement complaint against the same defendants in E.D. Tex. alleging that one U.S. patent is infringed by certain of our LRDIMMs. On August 15, 2022, Netlist amended the second complaint to assert that two additional U.S. patents are infringed by certain of our LRDIMMs. The complaints in E.D. Tex. seek injunctive relief, damages, and attorneys’ fees. On May 23, 2024, following a four-day trial regarding the second complaint filed by Netlist in the E.D. Tex., a jury rendered a verdict that Micron’s memory modules infringe two asserted patents — U.S. Patent No. 7,619,912 (“the ‘912 patent”) and U.S. Patent No. 11,093,417 (“the ‘417 patent”) — and found that Micron should pay $ 425 million for infringement of the ‘912 patent and $ 20 million for infringement of the ‘417 patent. Micron expects to appeal the verdict. On April 17, 2024, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”) of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) issued a final written decision (“FWD”) finding unpatentable the sole asserted claim of the ‘912 patent. On September 10, 2024, Netlist filed a notice that it will appeal the ruling that the ‘912 patent is invalid to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (“Federal Circuit”). On July 30, 2024, the USPTO issued a FWD finding unpatentable all asserted claims of the ‘417 patent. On December 10, 2024, Netlist filed a notice that it will appeal the ruling that the ‘417 patent is invalid to the Federal Circuit. In the case of each of the ‘912 and ‘417 patents, if the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirms the FWD, then the affirmed FWD will preclude any pending actions asserting infringement of such patent (including any infringement verdict that is subject to an ongoing appeal). On January 23, 2023, Besang Inc. filed a patent infringement complaint against Micron in the U.S. District Court for the E.D. Tex. The complaint alleges that one U.S. patent is infringed by certain of our 3D NAND and SSD products. The complaint seeks an injunction, damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. 16 Table of Contents On November 9, 2023, Yangtze Memory Technologies Company, Ltd. (“YMTC”) filed a patent infringement complaint against Micron and one of its subsidiaries in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (“N.D. Cal.”). The complaint alleges that eight U.S. patents are infringed by certain of our 3D NAND products. The complaint seeks an injunction, damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. On January 22, 2024, Micron Semiconductor (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. (“MSS”) was served with three patent infringement complaints filed by YMTC in Beijing Intellectual Property Court and on February 27, 2024, Micron Technology, Inc. (“MTI”) was served with the same complaints. The complaints assert that MTI and MSS infringed three Chinese patents owned by YMTC by importing, selling, offering for sale, and assisting others to sell certain 3D NAND products and SSDs in China. The complaint seeks an injunction, damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. On July 12, 2024, YMTC filed a second complaint against the Company and its subsidiary in N.D. Cal. The second complaint alleges that eleven U.S. patents are infringed by certain of our 3D NAND and DDR5 DRAM products. The complaint seeks an injunction, damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. On September 11, 2024, MSS was served with five patent infringement complaints filed by YMTC in Shanghai Intellectual Property Court. The complaints assert that MTI and MSS infringed five Chinese patents owned by YMTC by importing, selling, offering for sale, and assisting others to sell certain 3D NAND products and SSDs in China. The complaint seeks an injunction, damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. On October 16, 2024, Palisade Technologies, LLP filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Micron and MSP in the U.S. District Court for the W.D. Tex. The complaint alleges that five U.S. patents are infringed by certain of our DRAM, NAND, 3D NAND, and SSD products. The complaint seeks an injunction, damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. The above lawsuits pertain to substantially all of our DRAM, NAND, and other memory and storage products we manufacture, which account for substantially all of our revenue. Antitrust Matters On May 15, 2018, the Chinese State Administration for Market Regulation (“SAMR”) notified Micron that it was investigating potential collusion and other anticompetitive conduct by DRAM suppliers in China. On May 31, 2018, SAMR made unannounced visits to our sales offices in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen to seek certain information as part of its investigation. We are cooperating with SAMR in its investigation. Other Matters In the normal course of business, we are a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify another party. It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these types of agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, our payments under these types of agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Contingency Assessment We ar e unable to predict the outcome of any of the matters noted above and cannot make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of possible losses. A determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others or entering into a license agreement covering such intellectual property could result in significant liability and/or require us to make material changes to our products and/or manufacturing processes. Any of the foregoing, as well as the resolution of any other legal matter noted above, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Equity Common Stock Repurchases Our Board of Directors has authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to $ 10 billion of our outstanding common stock through open-market purchases, block trades, privately-negotiated transactions, derivative transactions, and/or pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date, does not obligate us 17 | 2025 Q1 10-Q Table of Contents to acquire any common stock, and is subject to market conditions, restrictions applicable under our CHIPS Act direct funding agreements, and our ongoing determination of the best use of available cash. See “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – CHIPS Act Funding Agreements.” No shares were repurchased in the first quarter of 2025. Through November 28, 2024, we had repurchased an aggregate of $ 7.19 billion under the authorization. Amounts repurchased are included in treasury stock. Dividends In the first quarter of 2025, we declared and paid dividends of $ 0.115 per share. On December 18, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $ 0.115 per share, payable in cash on January 15, 2025 , to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 30, 2024 . Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by component for the three months ended November 28, 2024 were as follows: Gains (Losses) on Derivative Instruments Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Investments Pension Liability Adjustments Cumulative Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment Total As of August 29, 2024 $ ( 162 ) $ ( 8 ) $ 39 $ ( 3 ) $ ( 134 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ( 137 ) ( 2 ) — — ( 139 ) Amount reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 40 ( 1 ) — — 39 Tax effects 12 1 — — 13 Other comprehensive income (loss) ( 85 ) ( 2 ) — — ( 87 ) As of November 28, 2024 $ ( 247 ) $ ( 10 ) $ 39 $ ( 3 ) $ ( 221 ) Fair Value Measurements The estimated fair values and carrying values of our outstanding debt instruments were as follows: As of November 28, 2024 As of August 29, 2024 Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Notes payable and term loans $ 11,178 $ 11,306 $ 11,316 $ 11,343 The fair values of our debt instruments were estimated based on Level 2 inputs, including the trading price of our notes when available, discounted cash flows, and interest rates based on similar debt issued by parties with credit ratings similar to ours. 18 Table of Contents Derivative Instruments Notional or Contractual Amount Fair Value (1) of Assets (2) Liabilities (3) As of November 28, 2024 Derivative instruments with hedge accounting designation Cash flow currency hedges $ 3,676 $ 1 $ ( 120 ) Cash flow commodity hedges 492 9 ( 18 ) Fair value currency hedges 2,260 7 ( 8 ) Fair value interest rate hedges 900 — ( 72 ) Derivative instruments without hedge accounting designation Non-designated currency hedges 2,921 6 ( 25 ) $ 23 $ ( 243 ) As of August 29, 2024 Derivative instruments with hedge accounting designation Cash flow currency hedges $ 3,724 $ 57 $ ( 71 ) Cash flow commodity hedges 471 20 ( 7 ) Fair value currency hedges 2,511 — ( 41 ) Fair value interest rate hedges 900 — ( 60 ) Derivative instruments without hedge accounting designation Non-designated currency hedges 2,393 18 ( 3 ) $ 95 $ ( 182 ) (1) Forward and swap contracts are measured at fair value based on market-based observable inputs including market spot and forward rates, interest rates, and credit-risk spreads (Level 2). (2) Included in receivables and other noncurrent assets. (3) Included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other noncurrent liabilities. Derivative Instruments with Hedge Accounting Designation Cash Flow Hedges : We utilize forward and swap contracts that generally mature within two years designated as cash flow hedges to minimize our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates or commodity prices for certain capital expenditures and manufacturing costs. The effects of cash flow hedging activities were as follows: Three months ended November 28, 2024 November 30, 2023 Gain (loss) from cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) $ ( 133 ) $ 2 Gain (loss) excluded from effectiveness testing in cost of goods sold ( 29 ) ( 36 ) Gain (loss) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings, primarily to cost of goods sold ( 40 ) ( 44 ) As of November 28, 2024, we expect to reclassify $ 116 million of pre-tax losses related to cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings in the next 12 months. 19 | 2025 Q1 10-Q Table of Contents Fair Value Hedges : We utilize currency forward contracts that generally mature within one year designated as fair value hedges to minimize our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates for non-U.S.-dollar-denominated cash and investments in debt securities. The fair value of our hedged cash and investments in debt securities was $ 2.26 billion as of November 28, 2024. The changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as fair value hedges and the offsetting changes in the underlying fair values of the hedged items are both recognized in earnings. We recognized gains of $ 96 million for changes in the fair values of our fair value currency hedges and offsetting losses of $ 97 million for changes in the underlying fair values of the hedged items in other non-operating income (expense) for the first quarter of 2025. The effects of the fair value currency hedges and the hedged items were not significant for the first quarter of 2024. We also utilize fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges to minimize certain exposures to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt that result from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates. The effects of fair value hedges on our consolidated statements of operations, recognized in interest expense, were not significant for the periods presented. Derivative Instruments without Hedge Accounting Designation Currency Derivatives : We generally utilize a rolling hedge strategy with currency forward contracts that mature within three months to hedge our exposures of monetary assets and liabilities from changes in currency exchange rates. At the end of each reporting period, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are remeasured into U.S. dollars and the associated outstanding forward contracts are marked to market. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments without hedge accounting designation as well as the changes in the underlying monetary assets and liabilities from changes in currency exchange rates are included in other non-operating income (expense), net. We recognized losses of $ 56 million for derivative instruments without hedge accounting designation for the first quarter of 2025. The amounts recognized for the first quarter of 2024 were not significant. We do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes. Equity Compensation Plans As of November 28, 2024, 50 million shares of our common stock were available for future awards under our equity compensation plans, including 11 million shares approved for issuance under our employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”). Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units (“Restricted Stock Awards”) Restricted Stock Awards activity is summarized as follows: Three months ended November 28, 2024 November 30, 2023 Restricted stock award shares granted 10 12 Weighted-average grant-date fair value per share $ 100.95 $ 67.36 20 Table of Contents Stock-based Compensation Expense Stock-based compensation expense recognized in our statements of operations is presented below. Stock-based compensation expense of $ 101 million and $ 99 million was capitalized and remained in inventory as of November 28, 2024 and August 29, 2024, respectively. Three months ended November 28, 2024 November 30, 2023 Stock-based compensation expense by caption Cost of goods sold $ 90 $ 67 Research and development 77 68 Selling, general, and administrative 50 47 $ 217 $ 182 Stock-based compensation expense by type of award Restricted stock awards $ 192 $ 163 ESPP 25 19 $ 217 $ 182 As of November 28, 2024, $ 2.14 billion of total unrecognized compensation costs for unvested awards, before the effect of any future forfeitures, was expected to be recognized through the first quarter of 2029, resulting in a weighted-average period of 1.4 years. 21 | 2025 Q1 10-Q Table of Contents Revenue and Customer Contract Liabilities Revenue by Technology Three months ended November 28, 2024 November 30, 2023 DRAM $ 6,400 $ 3,427 NAND 2,241 1,230 Other (primarily NOR) 68 69 $ 8,709 $ 4,726 See “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Segment and Other Information” for disclosure of disaggregated revenue by market segment. Revenue is primarily recognized at a point in time when control of the promised goods is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods. Substantially all contracts with our customers are short-term in duration at fixed, negotiated prices with payment generally due shortly after delivery. From time to time, we have contracts with initial terms that include performance obligations that extend beyond one year. As of November 28, 2024, our future performance obligations beyond one year were $ 141 million, which included customer prepayments and other contract liabilities. As of November 28, 2024 and August 29, 2024, customer prepayments made to secure product supply in future periods and other contract liabilities were $ 614 million and $ 907 million, respectively, of which $ 473 million and $ 766 million were reported in other current liabilities, respectively. The remainder of the customer prepayments and other contract liabilities were in other noncurrent liabilities. Revenue recognized during the first three months of 2025 from the beginning balance as of August 29, 2024 included $ 301 million from shipments against customer prepayments and other contract liabilities. As of November 28, 2024 and August 29, 2024, other current liabilities included $ 858 million and $ 718 million, respectively, for estimates of consideration payable to customers including estimates for pricing adjustments and returns. Income Taxes Our income tax (provision) benefit consisted of the following: Three months ended November 28, 2024 November 30, 2023 Income (loss) before taxes $ 2,152 $ ( 1,155 ) Income tax (provision) benefit ( 283 ) ( 73 ) Effective tax rate 13.2 % ( 6.3 ) % For the first quarter of 2024, our tax expense was based on actual results for jurisdictions where small changes in our projected pre-tax income would have caused significant changes in the estimated annual effective tax rate. Beginning in the second quarter of 2024, we were able to estimate a more reliable annual effective tax rate and reverted to a global annual effective tax rate method for all jurisdictions. The change in our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2025 as compared to the first quarter of 2024 was primarily due to changes in profitability and the calculation of our tax expense using actual results in the first quarter of 2024. We operate in a number of jurisdictions outside the United States, including Singapore, where we have tax incentive arrangements. These incentives expire, in whole or in part, at various dates through 2034 and are conditional, in 22 Table of Contents part, upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds. The effect of tax incentive arrangements reduced our tax provision by $ 212 million (benefiting our diluted earnings per share by $ 0.19 ) for the first quarter of 2025. As a result of a loss before taxes and geographic mix of income, the benefit from tax incentive arrangements was not material for the first quarter 2024. Earnings Per Share Three months ended November 28, 2024 November 30, 2023 Net income (loss) – Basic and Diluted $ 1,870 $ ( 1,234 ) Weighted-average common shares outstanding – Basic 1,111 1,100 Dilutive effect of equity compensation plans 11 — Weighted-average common shares outstanding – Diluted 1,122 1,100 Earnings (loss) per share Basic $ 1.68 $ ( 1.12 ) Diluted 1.67 ( 1.12 ) Antidilutive potential common shares excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share, that could dilute basic earnings per share in the future, were 2 million for the first quarter of 2025 and 35 million for the first quarter of 2024. Segment and Other Information Segment information reported herein is consistent with how it is reviewed and evaluated by our chief operating decision maker. We have the following four business units, which are our reportable segments: Compute and Networking Business Unit (“CNBU”) : Includes memory products and solutions sold into the data center, PC, graphics, and networking markets.

On December 9, 2024, we also signed a non-binding preliminary memorandum of terms for up to $ 275 million in direct funding for our fab in Manassas, Virginia. Funding will be based on the achievement of construction, tool installation, and wafer production milestones. We retain discretion with respect to capacity and production volume ramp of each project. The agreements contain representations, warranties, and covenants that relate to compliance with requirements for awards provided for in the CHIPS Act. In addition, the agreements include certain events of default and related rights and remedies, including clawbacks related to the failure to complete a project by an agreed upon completion date, violation of CHIPS Act restrictions on certain activities involving foreign countries and entities of concern, and impermissible use or disposition of a project. We are permitted to make customary and ordinary course recurring dividends (and reasonable ordinary course increases thereof) consistent with our past practice. There are restrictions on our payment of special and one-time dividends during the five-year period following the award date of December 9, 2024. Share repurchases are permitted during the first two years of such five-year period up to amounts specified in the funding agreements to help offset the dilutive effects of employee stock compensation or as otherwise permitted by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Share repurchases are not restricted during the final three years of such five-year period if certain financial and other conditions are satisfied. We may be required to pay upside sharing amounts for a period of up to ten years following the first year in which the cumulative cash flow from a project is positive, if cumulative cash flows from the project exceed a threshold level that is at a significant premium to the baseline projection. The upside sharing amount would equal a modest sharing percentage of the excess cash flows above the threshold level, but not to exceed 75% of award disbursements for a project, after considering any clawbacks or other repayments. 25 | 2025 Q1 10-Q Table of Contents ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the year ended August 29, 2024 . All period references are to our fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated. Our fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period ending on the Thursday closest to August 31. Fiscal 2025 and 2024 each contain 52 weeks. All tabular dollar amounts are in millions, except per share amounts. Overview We are an industry leader in innovative memory and storage solutions transforming how the world uses information to enrich life for all . With a relentless focus on our customers, technology leadership, manufacturing, and operational excellence, Micron delivers a rich portfolio of high-performance DRAM, NAND, and NOR memory and storage products through our Micron® and Crucial® brands. Every day, the innovations that our people create fuel the data economy, enabling advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and compute-intensive applications that unleash opportunities — from the data center to the intelligent edge and across the client and mobile user experience. We manufacture our products at wholly-owned facilities and also utilize subcontractors for certain manufacturing processes. Our global network of manufacturing centers of excellence not only allows us to benefit from scale while streamlining processes and operations, but it also brings together some of the world’s brightest talent to work on the most advanced memory technology. Centers of excellence bring expertise together in one location, providing an efficient support structure for end-to-end manufacturing, with quicker cycle times, in partnership with teams such as research and development (“R&D”), product development, human resources, procurement, and supply chain. For our locations in Singapore and Taiwan, this is also a combination of bringing fabrication and back-end manufacturing together. We make significant investments to develop proprietary product and process technology, which generally increases bit density per wafer and reduces per-bit manufacturing costs of each generation of product. We continue to introduce new generations of products that offer improved performance characteristics, including higher data transfer rates, advanced packaging solutions, lower power consumption, improved read/write reliability, and increased memory density. We face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets. To remain competitive we must continuously develop and implement new products and technologies and decrease manufacturing costs in spite of inflationary pressures. Our success is largely dependent on obtaining returns on our R&D investments, efficient utilization of our manufacturing infrastructure, development and integration of advanced product and process technologies, market acceptance of our diversified portfolio of semiconductor-based memory and storage solutions, and efficient capital spending. Product Technologies Our product portfolio of memory and storage solutions, advanced solutions, and storage platforms is based on our high-performance semiconductor memory and storage technologies, including DRAM, NAND, and NOR. We sell our products through our business units into various markets in numerous forms, including: components, modules, SSDs, managed NAND, multi-chip packages, and wafers. Many of our system-level solutions combine NAND, a controller, firmware, and in some cases DRAM. DRAM: DRAM products are dynamic random access memory semiconductor devices with low latency that provide high-speed data retrieval with a variety of performance characteristics. DRAM products lose content when power is turned off (“volatile”) and are most commonly used in the data center, client PC, graphics, industrial, and automotive markets. NAND : NAND products are non-volatile, re-writeable semiconductor storage devices that provide high-capacity, low-cost storage with a variety of performance characteristics. NAND is used in SSDs for the data center, client PC, consumer, and automotive markets and in removable storage markets. Managed NAND is used in smartphones and other mobile devices, and in consumer, automotive, and embedded markets. Low-density NAND is ideal for applications like automotive, surveillance, machine-to-machine, automation, printer, and home networking. 26 Table of Contents NOR : NOR products are non-volatile, re-writable semiconductor memory devices that provide fast read speeds. NOR is most commonly used for reliable code storage (e.g., boot, application, operating system, and execute-in-place code in an embedded system) and for frequently changing small data storage and is ideal for automotive, industrial, and consumer applications. Industry Conditions Throughout 2024 and the first quarter of 2025, we experienced substantial improvements in pricing and margins for DRAM. Increasing demand growth, driven in part by deployment of AI and mostly normal customer inventories, combined with industry-wide supply discipline, resulted in a substantially improved industry supply and demand balance. Leading edge DRAM demand remains tight, driven by HBM supply ramp in the industry. In the PC, smartphone, and consumer markets, our bit shipments are expected to be weaker until inventories in these markets reach healthier levels expected in the spring. In line with prior plans, we shifted our supply to meet the strong demand in data center DRAM resulting in a portfolio mix weighted more towards high growth and less seasonal segments. We also experienced substantial improvements in pricing and margins for NAND throughout 2024. In the first quarter of 2025, after several quarters of very robust revenue, NAND shipments and prices decreased as customers worked to reduce inventories to align with demand in their end markets. As NAND technology node transitions provide increases in bit output, the pace of technology transitions will need to slow to align supply to industry demand. We are taking prompt and decisive action to align our NAND supply with industry demand trends, including reducing NAND wafer starts and NAND capital expenditures. Recent Developments In December 2024, we entered into direct funding agreements with the U.S. Department of Commerce for up to $6.1 billion in direct funding pursuant to the CHIPS Act for a planned fab in Idaho and two planned fabs in New York, as well as a non-binding preliminary memorandum of terms for up to $275 million in direct funding for our fab in Virginia. See “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – CHIPS Act Funding Agreements.” 27 | 2025 Q1 10-Q Table of Contents Results of Operations Consolidated Results First Quarter Fourth Quarter First Quarter 2025 2024 2024 Revenue $ 8,709 100 % $ 7,750 100 % $ 4,726 100 % Cost of goods sold 5,361 62 % 5,013 65 % 4,761 101 % Gross margin 3,348 38 % 2,737 35 % (35) (1) % Research and development 888 10 % 903 12 % 845 18 % Selling, general, and administrative 288 3 % 295 4 % 263 6 % Other operating (income) expense, net (2) — % 17 — % (15) — % Operating income (loss) 2,174 25 % 1,522 20 % (1,128) (24) % Interest income (expense), net (11) — % (5) — % — — % Other non-operating income (expense), net (11) — % (7) — % (27) (1) % Income tax (provision) benefit (283) (3) % (623) (8) % (73) (2) % Equity in net income (loss) of equity method investees 1 — % — — % (6) — % Net income (loss) $ 1,870 21 % $ 887 11 % $ (1,234) (26) % Total Revenue: Total revenue for first quarter of 2025 and 2024 was impacted by the factors described in the section titled “Industry Conditions” above. Total revenue for the first quarter of 2025 increased 12% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2024 primarily due to increases in sales of DRAM products, partially offset by decreases in sales of NAND products. • Sales of DRAM products increased 20% primarily due to a low-double-digit percent range increase in bit shipments driven by demand in data center markets and a high-single-digit percent range increase in average selling prices. • Sales of NAND products decreased 5% primarily due to a low-single-digit percent range decrease in bit shipments and a low-single-digit percent range decrease in average selling prices. Total revenue for the first quarter of 2025 increased 84% as compared to the first quarter of 2024 primarily due to increases in sales of both DRAM and NAND products. • Sales of DRAM products increased 87% primarily due to a high-70% range increase in average selling prices and increases in bit shipments in the mid-single-digit percent range. • Sales of NAND products increased 82% primarily due to a high-60% range increase in average selling prices and an approximate 10% increase in bit shipments. Consolidated Gross Margin : Our consolidated gross margin has been impacted by the factors described in the section titled “Industry Conditions” above. Our consolidated gross margin percentage improved to 38% for the first quarter of 2025 from 35% for the fourth quarter of 2024, primarily due to improvements in margins for both DRAM and NAND products, as well as an increase in the share of revenue from DRAM. DRAM margins improved due to increases in average selling prices and a mix shift to high value HBM and DDR5 products. NAND margins improved primarily due to manufacturing cost reductions. Our consolidated gross margin percentage improved to 38% for the first quarter of 2025 from negative 1% for the first quarter of 2024 primarily due to increases in average selling prices and manufacturing cost reductions for both DRAM and NAND. Our consolidated gross margin for the first quarter of 2024 reflected $605 million of benefit due to lower costs from the sale of inventories written down to their net realizable value in 2023. 28 Table of Contents Revenue by Business Unit First Quarter Fourth Quarter First Quarter 2025 2024 2024 CNBU $ 4,395 50 % $ 3,018 39 % $ 1,737 37 % SBU 1,731 20 % 1,681 22 % 653 14 % MBU 1,527 18 % 1,875 24 % 1,293 27 % EBU 1,052 12 % 1,172 15 % 1,037 22 % All Other 4 — % 4 — % 6 — % $ 8,709 $ 7,750 $ 4,726 Percentages of total revenue may not total 100% due to rounding. Changes in revenue for each business unit for first quarter of 2025 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2024 were as follows: • CNBU revenue increased 46% primarily due to increases in bit shipments and average selling prices driven by cloud server DRAM demand, including HBM. • SBU revenue increased 3% primarily due to increases in bit shipments driven by demand in the data center SSD end market. • MBU revenue decreased 19% primarily due to decreases in bit shipments as output was shifted to higher demand data center markets, and declines in average selling prices for both mobile DRAM and NAND. • EBU revenue decreased 10% primarily due to decreases in bit shipments for both DRAM and NAND, as auto, industrial, and consumer customers managed inventories lower, and decreases in average selling prices for NAND. Changes in revenue for each business unit for first quarter of 2025 as compared to the first quarter of 2024 were as follows: • CNBU revenue increased 153% primarily due to increases in average selling prices and increases in bit shipments driven by improved demand, particularly in cloud server markets, including HBM. • SBU revenue increased 165% primarily due to increases in average selling prices and bit shipments for NAND. • MBU revenue increased 18% primarily due to increases in average selling prices for both DRAM and NAND, partially offset by decreases in bit shipments. • EBU revenue increased 1% primarily due to increases in bit shipments, partially offset by declines in average selling prices.

Changes in operating income or loss for each business unit for the first quarter of 2025 as compared to the first quarter of 2024 were as follows: • CNBU operating income (loss) improved primarily due to increases in average selling prices and higher bit shipments. • SBU operating income (loss) improved primarily due to increases in average selling prices, higher bit shipments, and manufacturing cost reductions. • MBU operating income (loss) improved primarily due to increases in average selling prices and manufacturing cost reductions, partially offset by lower bit shipments. • EBU operating income was relatively unchanged as higher bit shipments and manufacturing cost reductions were offset by declines in average selling prices. Operating Expenses and Other Research and Development: R&D expenses vary primarily with the number of development and pre-qualification wafers processed, the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development, and personnel costs. Because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products, we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing. Development of a product is deemed complete when it is qualified through internal reviews and tests for performance and reliability. R&D expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification. R&D expenses for the first quarter of 2025 were relatively unchanged as compared to the fourth quarter of 2024. R&D expenses for the first quarter of 2025 increased 5% as compared to the first quarter of 2024 primarily due to an increase in employee compensation, partially offset by lower volumes of development and prequalification wafers. Selling, General, and Administrative: SG&A expenses for the first quarter of 2025 were relatively unchanged as compared to the fourth quarter of 2024. SG&A expenses for the first quarter of 2025 increased 10% as compared to the first quarter of 2024 primarily due to an increase in employee compensation. Income Taxes: Our income tax (provision) benefit consisted of the following: First Quarter Fourth Quarter First Quarter 2025 2024 2024 Income (loss) before taxes $ 2,152 $ 1,510 $ (1,155) Income tax (provision) benefit (283) (623) (73) Effective tax rate 13.2 % 41.3 % (6.3) % In the first quarter of 2024, our tax expense was based on actual results for jurisdictions where small changes in our projected pre-tax income would have caused significant changes in the estimated annual effective tax rate. Beginning in the second quarter of 2024, we were able to estimate a more reliable annual effective tax rate and reverted to a global annual effective tax rate method for all jurisdictions. The change in our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2025 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2024 was primarily due to changes in profitability. The change in our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2025 as compared to the first quarter of 2024 was primarily due to changes in profitability and the calculation of our tax expense using actual results in the first quarter of 2024. 30 Table of Contents We operate in a number of jurisdictions outside the United States, including Singapore, where we have tax incentive arrangements. These incentives expire, in whole or in part, at various dates through 2034 and are conditional, in part, upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds. The effect of tax incentive arrangements reduced our tax provision by $212 million (benefiting our diluted earnings per share by $0.19) for the first quarter of 2025. As a result of the low levels of profitability and jurisdictional mix of income, the benefit from tax incentive arrangements was not material for the periods presented for 2024. Further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project, including Pillar Two Model Rules (“Pillar Two”), undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”). Nearly all European Union member states have enacted the Pillar Two legislation, which will be effective for us in 2025. We do not expect these enacted laws to materially impact our effective tax rate for 2025. On November 27, 2024, Singapore enacted legislation to implement Pillar Two, which will apply to us starting in 2026. While we are still evaluating the impacts, we expect our effective tax rate for 2026 to be in the high-teens percentage range. We also continue to monitor for additional guidance and legislative changes to Pillar Two in the jurisdictions where we operate. Various tax reforms are being considered in multiple jurisdictions that, if enacted, contain provisions that could materially impact our tax expense. We continue to monitor the potential impact of these various tax reform proposals to our overall global effective tax rate and financial statements. Other: Further information related to our operating expenses and other can be found in “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Equity Compensation Plans”: Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and financing obtained from capital markets and financial institutions. Cash generated from operations is highly dependent on selling prices for our products, which can vary significantly from period to period. Cash and marketable investments totaled $8.74 billion as of November 28, 2024, and $9.15 billion as of August 29, 2024. Our cash and investments consist primarily of bank deposits, money market funds, and liquid investment-grade, fixed-income securities, which are diversified among industries and individual issuers. To mitigate credit risk, we invest through high-credit-quality financial institutions and by policy generally limit the concentration of credit exposure by restricting the amount of investments with any single obligor. As of November 28, 2024, $2.70 billion of our cash and marketable investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries. We continuously evaluate alternatives for efficiently funding our capital expenditures and ongoing operations. We expect to engage in a variety of financing transactions, from time to time, for such purposes as well as to refinance our existing indebtedness, including the issuance of securities. As of November 28, 2024, $2.50 billion was available to draw under our Revolving Credit Facility. Funding of certain significant capital projects is also dependent on the receipt of government incentives, which are subject to conditions and may not be obtained. To develop new product and process technology, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality, we must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies, facilities and equipment, and R&D. We estimate capital expenditures in 2025 for property, plant, and equipment, net of proceeds from government incentives, to be approximately $14 billion plus or minus $500 million. Actual amounts for 2025 will vary depending on market conditions and may vary from quarter to quarter due to the timing of expenditures and proceeds from government incentives. As of November 28, 2024, we had purchase obligations of approximately $1.49 billion for the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment, of which approximately $1.46 billion is expected to be paid within one year. For a description of other contractual obligations, such as leases and debt, see “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Leases,” and “ – Debt.” 31 | 2025 Q1 10-Q Table of Contents To support projected memory demand in the second half of the decade, we will need to add new DRAM wafer capacity. Following the enactment of the CHIPS Act, we announced plans to invest in two leading-edge memory manufacturing fab facilities in the United States, based on CHIPS Act support through grants and investment tax credits. As part of this plan, in September 2022, we broke ground on a leading-edge memory manufacturing fab in Boise, Idaho. Construction of the fab began in October 2023, with meaningful DRAM output projected in 2027. In addition, in October 2022, we announced plans to build a second leading-edge DRAM manufacturing facility, consisting of up to four fabs to be built over the next 20-plus years, in Clay, New York. We expect construction site preparation to begin in calendar 2025, with production anticipated to ramp in the latter half of the decade. We expect these new fabs to be key to meeting our requirements for additional wafer capacity starting in the second half of the decade and beyond, in line with industry demand trends and our objective of maintaining stable bit share. On December 9, 2024, we entered into direct funding agreements with the U.S. Department of Commerce for up to $6.1 billion in direct funding pursuant to the CHIPS Act for a planned fab in Boise, Idaho and two planned fabs in Clay, New York. On December 9, 2024, we also signed a non-binding preliminary memorandum of terms for up to $275 million in direct funding for our fab in Manassas, Virginia. See “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – CHIPS Act Funding Agreements.” We elected not to pursue the federal loans previously disclosed as included in the non-binding preliminary memorandum of terms for the Boise, Idaho and Clay, New York fabs. In addition, we receive a 25% investment tax credit on qualified investments in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing under the CHIPS Act. We have also signed a non-binding term sheet with the State of New York that provides up to $5.5 billion in funding for the planned four-fab facility over the next 20-plus years through a combination of tax credits for qualified capital investments and incentives for eligible new job wages. Additionally, we began enablement of cleanroom space within our existing manufacturing fab in Hiroshima, Japan, that will support production of advanced DRAM using EUV lithography. We also continue to advance our global back-end assembly and test network in order to support our product portfolio and extend our ability to deliver on global customer demand in the future. We have started construction to expand our existing assembly and test facility in Xi’an, China, to provide space to add more product capability, to allow us over time to serve more of the demand from our customers in China. Construction is also progressing for the assembly and test facility in Gujarat, India to address demand in the latter half of this decade. Our Board of Directors has authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to $10 billion of our outstanding common stock through open-market purchases, block trades, privately-negotiated transactions, derivative transactions, and/or pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date, does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, and is subject to market conditions, restrictions applicable under our CHIPS Act direct funding agreements, and our ongoing determination of the best use of available cash. Through November 28, 2024, we had repurchased an aggregate of $7.19 billion of the authorized amount. See “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Equity” and “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – CHIPS Act Funding Agreements.” On December 18, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.115 per share, payable in cash on January 15, 2025, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 30, 2024. The declaration and payment of any future cash dividends are at the discretion and subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors' decisions regarding the amount and payment of dividends will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions, debt service obligations, contractual restrictions, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. We expect that our cash and investments, cash flows from operations, expected funding from government incentives, and available financing will be sufficient to meet our requirements at least through the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. 32 Table of Contents Cash Flows Three months ended November 28, 2024 November 30, 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,244 $ 1,401 Net cash provided by (used for) investing activities (3,148) (1,558) Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities (422) (352) Effect of changes in currency exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash (29) (1) Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ (355) $ (510) Operating Activities: Cash provided by operating activities reflects net income (loss) adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation expense, amortization of intangible assets, and stock-based compensation, and the effects of changes in operating assets and liabilities . Th e increase in cash provided by operating activities for the first three months of 2025 as compared to the first three months of 2024 was primarily due to net income in the current year adjusted for non-cash items, partially offset by the effect of an increase in receivables, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses, and a decrease in other current liabilities. Investing Activities: For the first three months of 2025, net cash used for investing activi ties consisted primarily of $3.21 billion of expenditures for property, plant, and equipment; partially offset by $65 million received from government incentives to offset capital expenditures and $51 million of net inflows from maturities, sales, and purchases of available-for-sale securities. For the first three months of 2024, net cash used for investing activities consisted primarily of $1.80 billion of expenditures for property, plant, and equipment; partially offset by $85 million received from government incentives to offset capital expenditures and $175 million of net inflows from maturities, sales, and purchases of available-for-sale securities. Financing Activities: For the first three months of 2025, net cash used for financing activi ties consisted primarily of $131 million for paym ents of dividends to shareholders and $84 million of repayments of debt . For the first three months of 2024, net cash used for financing activities consisted primarily of $129 million for payments of dividends to shareholders, $56 million of payments on equipment purchase contracts, and $53 million for repayments of debt.

SEC regulations require disclosure of certain proceedings related to environmental matters unless we reasonably believe that the related monetary sanctions, if any, will be less than a specified threshold. We use a threshold of $1 million for this purpose. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, this section discusses important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by us. The order of presentation is not necessarily indicative of the level of risk that each factor poses to us. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or stock price. Our operations could also be affected by other factors that are presently unknown to us or not considered significant. Risk Factor Summary Risks Related to Our Business, Operations, and Industry • volatility in average selling prices of our products; • a range of factors that may adversely affect our gross margins; • our international operations, including geopolitical risks; • the highly competitive nature of our industry; • our ability to develop and produce new and competitive memory and storage technologies and products; • realizing expected returns from capacity expansions; • achieving or maintaining certain outcomes and the compliance requirements associated with incentives from various governments; • availability and quality of materials, supplies, electrical power, water, and capital equipment, or dependency on third-party service providers; • a downturn in regional or worldwide economies; • disruptions to our manufacturing process from operational issues, natural disasters, or other events; • dependency on certain customers, including international customers, and end markets; • products that fail to meet specifications, are defective, or are incompatible with end uses; • breaches of our security systems or products, systems failures, interruptions, delays in service, catastrophic events, and resulting interruptions of our systems or those of our customers, suppliers, or business partners; • uncertainties and outcomes associated with the use and evolution of AI; • attracting, retaining, and motivating highly skilled employees; • responsible sourcing requirements and related regulations; • environmental, social, and governance expectations or standards; • acquisitions and/or alliances; and • restructure plans may not realize expected savings or other benefits.

Risks Related to Capitalization and Financial Markets • our ability to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing; • our debt obligations; • changes in foreign currency exchange rates; • counterparty default risk; • volatility in the trading price of our common stock; and • fluctuations in the amount and frequency of our common stock repurchases and payment of cash dividends and resulting impacts. 35 | 2025 Q1 10-Q Table of Contents Risks Related to Our Business, Operations, and Industry Volatility in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory and storage products may adversely affect our business. We have experienced significant volatility in our average selling prices and may continue to experience such volatility in the future. In the past five years, annual percentage changes in DRAM average selling prices have ranged from plus low-teen percentage range to a minus high-40% range. In the past five years, annual percentage changes in NAND average selling prices have ranged from plus low-30% to a minus low-50% range. In some prior periods, average selling prices for our products have been below our manufacturing costs and we may experience such circumstances in the future. Average selling prices for our products that decline faster than our costs have recently had an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and in future periods could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Our gross margins may be adversely affected by a range of factors. In addition to the impact of our average selling prices, our gross margins are dependent, in part, upon continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes and product designs. Factors that may limit our ability to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to prevent deterioration of or improve gross margins include, but are not limited to: • strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix; • increasing complexity of our product portfolio, which may impact operational costs; • increasing complexity of manufacturing processes; • difficulties in transitioning to smaller line-width process technologies or additional 3D memory layers or NAND cell levels; • process complexity including number of mask layers and fabrication steps; • manufacturing yield and defect density; • technological barriers; • changes in process technologies; • new products that may require relatively larger die sizes or advanced packaging technologies; • start-up or other costs associated with capacity expansions; • higher costs of goods and services due to inflationary pressures or market conditions; and • higher manufacturing costs per gigabit due to fabrication facility underutilization, lower wafer output, and insufficient volume to run new technology nodes to achieve cost optimization. Many factors may result in a reduction of our output or a delay in ramping production, which have in the past and could in the future lead to underutilization of our production assets. These factors may include, among others, a weak demand environment, industry oversupply, inventory surpluses, difficulties in ramping emerging technologies, supply chain disruptions, and delays from equipment suppliers. A significant portion of our manufacturing costs are fixed and do not vary proportionally with changes in production output. As a result, lower utilization, lower wafer output, and corresponding increases in our per gigabit manufacturing costs could result in higher inventory carrying costs, and have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our gross margins, business, results of operations, or financial condition. We have a broad portfolio of products to address our customers’ needs, which span multiple market segments and are subject to rapid technological changes. Our manufacturing costs on a per gigabit basis vary across our portfolio as they are largely influenced by the technology node in which the solution was developed. We strive to balance our demand and supply for each technology node, but the dynamics of our markets and our customers can create periods of imbalance, which can lead us to carry elevated inventory levels. Consequently, we may incur charges in connection with obsolete or excess inventories, or we may not fully recover our costs, which would reduce our gross margins. For example, in 2023, we recorded aggregate charges of $1.83 billion to write down the carrying value of our inventories to their estimated net realizable value. In addition, due to the customized nature of certain products we manufacture, we may be unable to sell certain finished goods inventories to alternative customers or manufacture in-process inventory to different specifications, which may result in excess and obsolescence charges in future periods. 36 Table of Contents In addition, if we are unable to supply products that meet customer design and performance specifications, we may be required to sell such products at lower average selling prices, which may reduce our gross margins. Our gross margins may also be impacted by shifts in product mix, driven by our strategy to optimize our portfolio to best respond to changing market dynamics. We may not be able to predict or quickly respond to trends in the dynamics of our markets and our customers or changes in customer demand, which could negatively impact our gross margin. Our inability to prevent deterioration of or improve gross margins could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. We face geopolitical and other risks associated with our international operations that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. In addition to our U.S. operations, a substantial portion of our operations are conducted in Taiwan, Singapore, Japan, Malaysia, China, and India, and many of our customers, suppliers, and vendors also operate internationally. In 2024, nearly half of our revenue was from sales to customers who have headquarters located outside the United States, while over 80% of our revenue in 2024 was from products shipped to customer locations outside the United States. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks, including: • restrictions on sales of goods or services to one or more of our significant foreign customers; • export and import duties, changes to import and export regulations, customs regulations and processes, and restrictions on the transfer of funds, including currency controls in China and tariffs in the United States, which could negatively affect the amount and timing of payments from certain of our customers and, as a result, our cash flows; • compliance with U.S. and international laws involving international operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, sanctions and anti-corruption laws, export and import laws, and similar rules and regulations; • theft of intellectual property; • political and economic instability, including instability resulting from domestic and international conflicts; • government actions or civil unrest preventing the flow of products and materials, including delays in shipping and obtaining products and materials, cancellation of orders, or loss or damage of products; • problems with the transportation or delivery of products and materials; • issues arising from cultural or language differences and labor unrest; • longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; • compliance with trade, technical standards, and other laws in a variety of jurisdictions; • contractual and regulatory limitations on the ability to maintain flexibility with staffing levels; • disruptions to manufacturing or R&D activities as a result of actions imposed by foreign governments; • changes in economic policies of foreign governments; • difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and • public health issues. If we or our customers, suppliers, or vendors are impacted by any of these risks, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Following the May 2023 decision of its cybersecurity review of our products sold in China, the CAC determined that critical information infrastructure operators in China may not purchase Micron products, impacting our revenue with companies headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong, including direct sales as well as indirect sales through distributors. Further actions by the Chinese government, through CAC action or other means, could impact revenue inside or outside China, or our operations in China, or our ability to ship products to our customers, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 37 | 2025 Q1 10-Q Table of Contents In addition, the U.S. government has in the past and continues to restrict American firms, including us, from selling products and software to certain of our customers and may in the future impose similar restrictions on one or more of our significant customers. These restrictions may not prohibit our competitors from selling similar products to our customers, which may result in our loss of sales and market share. Even as such restrictions are lifted, financial or other penalties or continuing export restrictions imposed with respect to our customers could have a continuing negative impact on our future revenue and results of operations, and we may not be able to recover any customers or market share we lose, or make such recoveries at acceptable average selling prices, while complying with such restrictions. Political, economic, or other actions may adversely affect our operations in Taiwan. A majority of our DRAM production output in 2024 was from our fabrication facilities in Taiwan, and any loss of output could have a material adverse effect on us. Any political, economic, or other actions may also adversely affect our customers and the technology industry supply chain, for which Taiwan is a central hub, and as a result, could have a material adverse impact on us. The semiconductor memory and storage markets are highly competitive. We face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets from a number of companies, including Kioxia Holdings Corporation; Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.; SK hynix Inc.; and Western Digital Corporation. Our competitors may use aggressive pricing to obtain market share. Some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have a larger market share and greater resources to invest in technology, capitalize on growth opportunities, and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete. Consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage as our competitors may benefit from increased manufacturing scale and a stronger product portfolio. Alternatively, new entrants into memory and storage market could have a significant adverse impact on our competitive position. We operate in different jurisdictions than our competitors and may be impacted by unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. In addition, some governments may provide, or have provided and may continue to provide, significant assistance, financial or otherwise, to some of our competitors or to new entrants and may intervene in support of national industries and/or competitors. As a result, we face the threat of increasing competition and oversupply due to significant investment in the semiconductor industry by the Chinese government and various state-owned or affiliated entities, such as Yangtze Memory Technologies Co., Ltd. (“YMTC”) and ChangXin Memory Technologies, Inc. (“CXMT”). In addition, the CAC’s decision that critical information infrastructure operators in China may not purchase Micron products had an adverse impact on our ability to compete effectively in China and elsewhere. We and our competitors generally seek to increase supply to address growing market demands, improve yields, and reduce die size, which could result in significant increases in worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices. Increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage also result from fabrication capacity expansions, either by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization, or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory and storage production. Our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply. We, and some of our competitors, have plans to ramp, or are constructing or ramping, production at new fabrication facilities. Increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage, if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand, could lead to declines in average selling prices for our products and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Additionally, rapid technological change in markets we serve could contribute to shortened product life cycles and a decline in average selling prices of our products. If competitors are more successful at developing or implementing new product or process technology, their products could have cost or performance advantages. The competitive nature of our industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 38 Table of Contents Our future success depends on our ability to develop and produce new and competitive memory and storage technologies and products. Our key semiconductor memory and storage technologies face technological barriers to continue to meet long-term customer needs. These barriers include achieving acceptable yields and quality for HBM products with their multiple chip layers, potential limitations on stacking additional 3D memory layers, increasing bits per cell (i.e., cell levels), meeting higher density requirements, developing advanced packaging solutions, improving power consumption and reliability, and delivering advanced features and higher performance. We may face technological barriers to continue to shrink our products at our current or historical rate, which has generally reduced per gigabit cost. We have invested and expect to continue to invest in R&D for new and existing products and process technologies, such as EUV lithography, to continue to deliver advanced product requirements. Such new technologies can add complexity and risk to our schedule and may affect our costs and production output. We may be unable to recover our investment in R&D or otherwise realize the economic benefits of reducing die size or increasing memory and storage densities. Our competitors are working to develop new memory and storage technologies that may offer performance and/or cost advantages to existing technologies and render existing technologies obsolete. Accordingly, our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce viable and competitive new memory and storage technologies. We are developing new products, including system-level memory and storage products and solutions, which complement our traditional products or leverage their underlying design or process technology. We have invested and expect to continue to invest in new semiconductor product and system-level solution development. We are increasingly differentiating our products and solutions to meet the specific demands of our customers, which increases our reliance on our customers’ ability to accurately forecast the needs and preferences of their customers. Recent technologies, such as generative AI models have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for HBM and other advanced products in the data center and other markets, the long-term trajectory is unknown and associated demand may fluctuate. As a result, our product demand forecasts may be impacted significantly by the strategic actions of our customers. In addition, our ability to successfully introduce new products often requires us to make product specification decisions multiple years in advance of when new products enter the market. It is important that we deliver products in a timely manner with increasingly advanced performance characteristics at the time our customers are designing and evaluating samples for their products. If we do not meet their product design schedules, our customers may exclude us from further consideration as a supplier for those products. The process to develop new products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality, performance, and reliability, often well in advance of a planned ramp of production, in order to secure design wins with our customers. Many factors may negatively impact our ability to meet anticipated timelines and/or expected or required quality standards with respect to the development of certain of our products. In addition, some of our components have long lead-times, requiring us to place orders up to a year in advance of anticipated demand. Such long lead-times increase the risk of excess inventory or loss of sales in the event our forecasts vary substantially from actual demand. There can be no assurance of the following: • we will be successful in developing competitive new semiconductor memory and storage technologies and products; • we will be able to cost-effectively manufacture new products; • we will be able to successfully market these technologies; • margins and cash flows generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts; • we will be able to establish or maintain key relationships with customers, or that we will not be prohibited from working with certain customers, for specific chip set or design requirements; • we will accurately predict and design products that meet our customers' specifications; or • we will be able to introduce new products into the market and qualify them with our customers on a timely basis. Unsuccessful efforts to develop new memory and storage technologies and products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 39 | 2025 Q1 10-Q Table of Contents We may not be able to achieve expected returns from capacity expansions. We have commenced expansion of our production capacity in the United States and in other regions where we operate. Semiconductor fabs are complex, capital-intensive projects and require specialized knowledge, expertise, experience, and skill sets to construct and operate. Our construction projects are highly dependent on available sources of materials, and specialized equipment, as well as labor, skilled sub-contractors and other service providers. Increasing demand, supply constraints, inflation, tariffs, and other market conditions could result in shortages and higher costs. Additionally, difficulties in obtaining labor, skilled sub-contractors and other service providers or other resources could result in delays in completion of our construction projects and cost increases, including costs to operate these facilities. In the United States and in certain other regions, fab building has been uncommon in recent years. Concurrent semiconductor expansion projects across the industry introduce significant competition for the limited pool of construction talent with requisite expertise and experience in these regions. As such, expanding production capacity in the United States and certain other regions may introduce more challenges than we would experience in geographies with more established ecosystems. In addition, these expansions involve several risks including the following: • inability to meet capital expenditure requirements for capacity expansions, including during periods of relatively low free cash flow generation, resulting from challenging memory and storage industry conditions; • unavailability of necessary funding, which may include external sources; • inability to realize expected grants, investment tax credits, and other government incentives, including through the CHIPS Act and other national, international, state, and local grants; • potential changes in laws or provisions of grants, investment tax credits, and other government incentives, including the CHIPS Act; • delays and potential restrictions related to environmental and other government regulations or permits; • potential restrictions on expanding in certain geographies; • inability to complete construction as scheduled and within budget; • inability to attract, retain and motivate key talent; • inability to timely ramp production in a cost-effective manner; • increases to our cost structure until new production is ramped to adequate scale; and • insufficient customer demand to utilize our increased capacity. From time to time, we have experienced impacts from certain of the above items and, because these risks are a characteristic of our business, we expect to experience them in the future. Depending on the nature and extent of the impact from these risks, we may be unable to produce sufficient capacity in the expected time frame which could result in delays in the completion of our construction projects and increased costs, including costs to operate these facilities. We invest our capital in areas that we believe best align with our business strategy and optimize future returns. Investments in capital expenditures may not generate expected returns or cash flows. Significant judgment is required to determine which capital investments will result in optimal returns, and we could invest in projects that are ultimately less profitable than those projects we do not select. Delays in completion and ramping of new production facilities, or failure to optimize our investment choices, could significantly impact our ability to realize expected returns on our capital expenditures. Any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 40 Table of Contents Our incentives from various governments are conditioned upon achieving or maintaining certain outcomes and satisfying compliance requirements and are subject to reduction, termination, or clawback, and could impose certain limitations on our business. We have received, and may in the future continue to receive, benefits and incentives from national, state, and local governments in various regions of the world designed to encourage us to establish, maintain, or increase investment, workforce, research and development, or production in those regions. However, there is no guarantee that such government incentives and benefits will continue to be available in the future on the same terms, terms that are acceptable to us or at all. In addition, we have discretion in the timing of use of certain of these incentives. If we choose to exercise such discretion due to the cyclicality of our business or other factors, we may not be able to fully utilize these incentives. Our future business plans may be impacted by obtaining these government incentives, which may take various forms, including grants, subsidies, loans, and tax arrangements, and typically require us to achieve or maintain certain levels of investment, capital spending, employment, technology deployment or development milestones, construction or production milestones, or research and development activities to qualify for such incentives or could restrict us from undertaking certain activities. Failure to achieve such milestones could result in up to all of certain incentives being clawed back. In some cases, these incentives have additional terms and conditions regarding our business operations or governance that are required to be satisfied as a condition to receive incentives or disbursements. Compliance with these terms and conditions may add complexity to our operations and increase our costs and failure to comply could result in termination of incentive programs or clawbacks of incentive amounts received. We may be unable to obtain sufficient future incentives to continue to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and operating costs, without which our cost structure may be adversely impacted and planned capital expenditures and research and development expenditures may be affected. For example, in December 2024, we entered into direct funding agreements, providing funds for the construction of fab facilities in Idaho and New York, with the United States Department of Commerce (the “Department”) under the Department’s CHIPS Incentives Program established pursuant to the CHIPS Act. The awards under the direct funding agreements are subject to various conditions and we may not receive the funding expected on the same terms or at all. We cannot guarantee that we will successfully achieve or maintain outcomes or satisfy the compliance requirements to qualify for these incentives or that the granting agencies will provide or continue to provide such funding. See “Part I. Financial Information –Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – CHIPS Act Funding Agreements.” These incentive arrangements, including the funding agreements, typically provide the granting agencies with rights to audit our compliance with their terms and obligations. Such audits could result in modifications to, or termination of, the applicable incentive program. In addition, the incentives we receive, including the funding agreements, are in some cases subject to reduction, termination, or clawback under certain circumstances, and any decrease or clawback of government incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be adversely affected by the availability and quality of materials, supplies, electrical power, water, and capital equipment, or dependency on third-party service providers. Our supply chain and operations are dependent on the availability of materials that meet exacting standards and the use of third parties to provide us with components and services. We generally have multiple sources of supply for our materials and services. However, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain materials, components, and services that meet our standards and, in some cases, materials, components, or services are provided by a single or sole source, and we may be unable to qualify new suppliers on a timely basis. The availability of materials or components such as chemicals, silicon wafers, gases, photoresist, controllers, substrates, lead frames, printed circuit boards, targets, and reticle glass blanks is impacted by various factors. These factors could include a shortage of raw materials or a disruption in the processing or purification of those raw materials into finished goods. Shortages or increases in lead times have occurred in the past, are currently occurring with respect to some materials and components, and may occur from time to time in the future because of the nature of the industry. Constraints within our supply chain for certain materials and integrated circuit components could limit our bit shipments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 41 | 2025 Q1 10-Q Table of Contents Our manufacturing processes are also dependent on our relationships with third-party manufacturers of controllers, analog integrated circuits, and other components used in some of our products and with outsourced semiconductor foundries, assembly and test providers, contract manufacturers, logistics carriers, and other service providers, including providers of maintenance for our advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment and providers of electricity and other utilities. Although we have certain long-term contracts with some of our suppliers, many of these contracts do not provide for long-term capacity or pricing commitments. To the extent we do not have firm commitments from our third-party suppliers over a specific time period or for any specific capacity, quantity, and/or pricing, our suppliers may allocate capacity to their other customers and capacity and/or materials may not be available when needed or at reasonable prices. Inflationary pressures may continue to increase costs for materials, supplies, and services. Regardless of contract structure, large swings in demand may exceed our contracted supply and/or our suppliers’ capacity to meet those demand changes resulting in a shortage of parts, materials, or capacity needed to manufacture our products. In addition, if any of our suppliers were to cease operations or become insolvent, this could impact their ability to provide us with necessary supplies, and we may not be able to obtain the needed supply in a timely way or at all from other providers. Certain materials are primarily available in a limited number of countries, including rare earth elements, minerals, and metals. Trade disputes, geopolitical tensions, economic circumstances, political conditions, or public health issues may limit our ability to obtain such materials. Although these rare earth and other materials are generally available from multiple suppliers, China is a predominant producer of these materials. China has in the past restricted export of certain of these materials and may in the future continue to restrict or stop exporting these materials, and as a result, our suppliers’ ability to obtain such supply may be constrained, and we may be unable to obtain sufficient quantities, or obtain supply in a timely manner, or at a commercially reasonable cost. Constrained supply of rare earth elements, minerals, and metals may restrict our ability to manufacture certain of our products and make it difficult or impossible to compete with other semiconductor memory and storage manufacturers who are able to obtain sufficient quantities of these materials from China. We and/or our suppliers and service providers could be affected by regional conflicts, civil unrest, labor disruptions, sanctions, tariffs, embargoes, or other trade restrictions, as well as laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change, conflict minerals, responsible sourcing practices, public health crises, or other matters, which could limit the supply of our materials and/or increase the cost. Environmental regulations could limit our ability to procure or use certain chemicals or materials in our operations or products. In addition, disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of materials. Our ability to procure components to repair equipment essential for our manufacturing processes could also be negatively impacted by various restrictions or disruptions in supply chains, among other items. The disruption of our supply of materials, components, or services, or the extension of our lead times could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Our operations are dependent on a reliable and uninterrupted supply of electrical power and water to our manufacturing facilities. Any power shortages, capacity constraints, prolonged outages, or significant or unexpected increases in the cost of power could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Our operations are dependent on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment that enables the transition to lower cost manufacturing processes. For certain key types of equipment, including photolithography tools, we are sometimes dependent on a single supplier. From time to time, we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to suppliers’ limited capacity. Our inability to obtain equipment on a timely basis could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing processes and reduce our costs. Delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production and could increase our overall costs of a ramp. Our inability to obtain advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Our construction projects to expand production and R&D capacity are highly dependent on available sources of labor, materials, equipment, and services. Increasing demand, supply constraints, inflation, and other market conditions could result in increasing shortages and higher costs for these items. Difficulties in obtaining these resources could result in delays in completion of our construction projects and cost increases, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 42 Table of Contents Our inability to source materials, supplies, capital equipment, or third-party services could affect our overall production output and our ability to fulfill customer demand. Significant or prolonged shortages of our products could halt customer manufacturing and damage our relationships with these customers. Any damage to our customer relationships as a result of a shortage of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Similarly, if our customers experience disruptions to their supplies, materials, components, or services, or the extension of their lead times, they may reduce, cancel, or alter the timing of their purchases with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Downturns in regional or worldwide economies may harm our business. Downturns in regional or worldwide economies, due to inflation, geopolitics, major central bank policy actions including interest rate increases, public health crises, or other factors, have harmed our business in the past and current and future downturns could also adversely affect our business. Adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that incorporate our products, such as personal computers, smartphones, automobiles, and servers. Reduced demand for these or other products could result in significant decreases in our average selling prices and product sales. In addition, to the extent our customers or distributors have elevated inventory levels or are impacted by a deterioration in credit markets, we may experience a decrease in short-term and/or long-term demand resulting in industry oversupply and declines in pricing for our products. A deterioration of conditions in regional or worldwide credit markets could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures. In addition, we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties. Difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivable due to credit defaults. Additionally, our current or potential future customers may experience cash flow problems and as a result may modify, delay, or cancel plans to purchase our products. Any inability of our current or potential future customers to pay us for our products may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow. As a result, downturns in regional or worldwide economies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. If our manufacturing process is disrupted by operational issues, natural disasters, or other events, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. We and our subcontractors manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance. Difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs. We and our subcontractors maintain operations and continuously implement new product and process technology at manufacturing facilities, which are widely dispersed in multiple locations in several countries including the United States, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, Malaysia, and China. As a result of the necessary interdependence within our network of manufacturing facilities, an operational disruption at one of our or a subcontractor’s facilities may have a disproportionate impact on our ability to produce many of our products. From time to time, there have been disruptions in our manufacturing operations as a result of power outages, improperly functioning equipment and facilities, disruptions in supply of raw materials or components, or equipment failures. We have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences and possible climate changes, such as severe and variable weather and geological events resulting in increased costs, or disruptions to our manufacturing operations or those of our suppliers or customers. In addition, climate change may pose physical risks to our manufacturing facilities or our suppliers’ facilities, including increased extreme weather events that could result in supply delays or disruptions. Other events, including political or public health crises, such as an outbreak of contagious diseases, may also affect our production capabilities or that of our suppliers, including as a result of quarantines, closures of production facilities, lack of supplies, or delays caused by restrictions on travel or shipping. Events of the types noted above have occurred from time to time and, because these risks are a characteristic of our business, they may occur in the future. As a result, in addition to disruptions to operations, our insurance premiums may increase or we may not be able to fully recover any sustained losses through insurance. 43 | 2025 Q1 10-Q Table of Contents If production is disrupted for any reason, manufacturing yields may be adversely affected, or we may be unable to meet our customers’ requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers. This could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs, loss of revenue, or damage to customer relationships, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. A significant portion of our revenue is concentrated with certain customers and end markets. Approximately one-half of our total revenue comes from our top ten customers. On end markets, approximately one-half of our total revenue is currently concentrated in the data center end market. A disruption in our relationship with any of our top customers or a significant decrease in demand for our data center products, or in the overall data center end market, could adversely affect our business. We could experience fluctuations in our customer base or the mix of revenue by customer or end market, as markets and strategies evolve. Demand for our products may fluctuate due to factors beyond our control. Our inability to qualify our products to meet customer or end market requirements could adversely impact our revenue. A meaningful change in inventory strategy by our top customers or in certain end markets could impact our industry bit demand growth outlook. In addition, consolidation impacting our customers or in significant end markets could limit the opportunity for sale of our products. The loss of, or restrictions on our ability to sell to, one or more of our major customers or in certain end markets, or any significant reduction in orders or a shift in product mix, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. See “Part I. Financial Information – Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Certain Concentrations.” Increases in sales of system solutions may increase our dependency upon specific customers and our costs to develop, qualify, and manufacture our system solutions. Our development of system-level memory and storage products is dependent, in part, upon successfully identifying and meeting our customers’ specifications for those products. Developing and manufacturing system-level products with specifications unique to a customer increases our reliance upon that customer for purchasing our products at sufficient volumes and prices in a timely manner. Even if our products meet customer specifications, our sales of system-level solutions are dependent upon our customers choosing our products over those of our competitors and purchasing our products at sufficient volumes and prices. Our competitors’ products may be less costly, provide better performance, or include additional features when compared to our products. Our long-term ability to sell system-level memory and storage products is reliant upon our customers’ ability to create, market, and sell their products containing our system-level solutions at sufficient volumes and prices in a timely manner. If we fail to successfully develop and market system-level products, our business, results of operations, or financial condition may be materially adversely affected. Manufacturing system-level solutions, such as SSDs, managed NAND, and HBM, typically results in higher per-unit manufacturing costs and longer cycle time as compared to other products. Even if we are successful in selling system-level solutions to our customers in sufficient volume, we may be unable to generate sufficient profit if our per-unit manufacturing costs are not offset by higher per-unit selling prices. Manufacturing system-level solutions to customer specifications requires a longer development cycle, as compared to discrete products, to design, test, and qualify, which may increase our costs. Some of our system solutions are increasingly dependent on sophisticated firmware that may require significant customization to meet customer specifications, which increases our costs and time to market. Additionally, we may need to update our controller and hardware design as well as our firmware or develop new firmware as a result of new product introductions or changes in customer specifications and/or industry standards, which increases our costs. System complexities and extended warranties for system-level products could also increase our warranty costs. Our failure to cost-effectively manufacture system-level solutions and/or controller, hardware design, and firmware in a timely manner may result in reduced demand for our system-level products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 44 Table of Contents Products that fail to meet specifications, are defective, or are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us. Products that do not meet specifications or that contain, or are perceived by our customers to contain, defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. From time to time, we experience problems with nonconforming, defective, or incompatible products after we have shipped such products. In recent periods, we have further diversified and expanded our product offerings, which could potentially increase the chance that one or more of our products could fail to meet specifications in a particular application. Our products and solutions may be deemed fully or partially responsible for functionality in our customers’ products and may result in sharing or shifting of product or financial liability from our customers to us for costs incurred by the end user as a result of our customers’ products failing to perform as specified. In addition, if our products and solutions perform critical functions in our customers’ products or are used in high-risk consumer end products, such as autonomous driver assistance programs, home and enterprise security, smoke and noxious gas detectors, medical monitoring equipment, or wearables for child and elderly safety, our potential liability may increase. We could be adversely affected in several ways, including the following: • we may be required or agree to compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible products and to replace products; • we could incur a decrease in revenue or adjustment to pricing commensurate with the reimbursement of such costs or alleged damages; and • we may encounter adverse publicity, which could cause a decrease in sales of our products or harm our reputation or relationships with existing or potential customers. Any of the foregoing items could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 45 | 2025 Q1 10-Q Table of Contents Breaches of our security systems or products, systems failures, interruptions, delays in service, catastrophic events, and resulting interruptions in the availability of our systems or those of our customers, suppliers, or business partners, could expose us to losses. We maintain a system of controls over the physical security of our facilities. We also manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations. In addition, we process, store, and transmit data relating to our customers and employees, including sensitive personal information. Unauthorized persons, employees, former employees, nation states, or other parties may gain access to our facilities or technology infrastructure and systems through fraudulent means and may steal trade secrets or other proprietary information, compromise confidential information, create system disruptions, or have other impacts. This risk is exacerbated as competitors for talent, particularly engineering talent, attempt to hire our employees. Through cyberattacks on technology infrastructure and systems, unauthorized parties may obtain access to computer systems, networks, and data, including cloud-based platforms. Our technology infrastructure and systems and that of our suppliers, vendors, service providers, cloud solution providers, and partners have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, such attacks, which could impact our operations. Cyberattacks can include ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, zero-day attacks, supply chain attacks, “phishing” and other forms of social engineering, exploitation of open source software vulnerabilities, and other malicious software programs or other attacks, including those using techniques that change frequently or may be disguised or difficult to detect, or designed to remain dormant until a triggering event, impersonation of authorized users, and efforts to discover and exploit any design flaws, “bugs,” security vulnerabilities, as well as intentional or unintentional acts by employees or other insiders with access privileges. The emergence and maturation of AI capabilities may also lead to new and/or more sophisticated methods of attack. Globally, cyberattacks are increasing in number and the attackers are increasingly organized and well-financed, or supported by state actors, and are developing increasingly sophisticated systems to not only attack, but also to evade detection. In addition, geopolitical tensions or conflicts may create a heightened risk of cyberattacks. Breaches of our physical security, including break-ins, sabotage or vandalism, attacks on our technology infrastructure and systems, security breaches or incidents, or attacks on our customers, suppliers, or business partners who maintain or otherwise process confidential or sensitive information regarding us and our customers and suppliers, could result in damage to, or loss, disruption, or unavailability of data or systems, or inappropriate disclosure, destruction, loss, or other processing of confidential or sensitive information. In addition, our systems and those of our third-party vendors may experience service interruptions, data loss or compromise and outages, for other reasons, including human error, pandemics, fires, other natural disasters, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks and other geopolitical unrest, computer viruses, ransomware, and other malicious software, changes in social, political, or regulatory conditions or in laws and policies, or other changes or events. Any such event, or the perception it has occurred, may result in significant losses and damage our reputation with customers and suppliers and may expose us to claims, demands, and litigation. Systems and applications that incorporate or otherwise utilize our products are also targets for cyberattacks. While some of our products contain encryption, security algorithms, or features designed to help protect third-party content, user-generated data stored on our products, or the functionality of our products as intended, systems and applications that utilize these products could be compromised, breached, or circumvented by motivated and sophisticated attackers. Further, our products contain sophisticated hardware, firmware and software (some of which is provided by third parties) that may contain weaknesses or defects in design or manufacture, including “bugs” and other problems that could interfere with the intended operation of our products or be potentially exploited by such attackers. If systems or applications that utilize our products experience a cyberattack, our products are attacked, or our suppliers are breached or attacked, this could harm our business by requiring us to employ additional resources to fix the errors or defects, and could expose us to litigation, claims, and harm to our reputation. We cannot be certain that any applicable insurance coverage we maintain will be adequate or otherwise protect us with respect to claims, expenses, fines, penalties, business loss, data loss, litigation, regulatory actions, or other impacts arising from security breaches or incidents, or that such coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or at all. Any of the foregoing security risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 46 Table of Contents We may be adversely impacted by any of the multiple uncertainties and outcomes associated with the use and evolution of AI. We are increasingly incorporating AI capabilities into the development of technologies and our business operations, and into our products and services. AI technology is complex and rapidly evolving, and may expose us to significant competitive, legal, regulatory, and other risks. The implementation of AI can be costly and there is no guarantee that our use of AI will enhance our technologies, benefit our business operations, or produce products and services that are preferred by our customers. AI will likely increase or change the competitive environment in our markets. Our competitors may be more successful in their AI strategy or they may have access to greater AI resources or technology and develop superior products and services. Additionally, AI algorithms or training methodologies may be flawed, and datasets may contain irrelevant, insufficient or biased information, which can cause errors in outputs. AI is also the subject of an evolving set of legal requirements and regulations and we may be subject to new and conflicting laws and regulations. Any of these matters may give rise to legal liability, damage our reputation, and materially harm our business. We must attract, retain, and motivate highly skilled employees. To remain competitive, we must maintain a highly skilled, diverse global workforce and effectively manage succession for key roles. Hiring, retaining and motivating qualified executives and other skilled talent is critical to our business and competition can be intense. If our total compensation programs, employment benefits, and workplace culture are not viewed as competitive and inclusive, our ability to attract and retain talent could be compromised. At times, we experience higher levels of attrition and more intense competition for talent across our industry, which can lead to increased compensation costs. To the extent we experience significant attrition and are unable to timely replace employees, we could experience a loss of critical skills and reduced employee morale, potentially resulting in business disruptions, inefficiencies during transitional periods and increased expenses. Additionally, changes to immigration policies in the countries in which we operate, as well as restrictions on travel due to public health crises or other causes, may limit our ability to hire and/or retain talent in, or transfer talent to, specific locations. Our business success is dependent on our ability to attract, retain and motivate key talent. Our inability to do so could inhibit our ability to maintain or expand our business operations and may adversely impact our operating results. Compliance with responsible sourcing requirements and any related regulations could increase our operating costs or limit the supply and increase the cost of certain materials, supplies, and services, and if we fail to comply, customers may reduce purchases from us or disqualify us as a supplier. We and many of our customers have adopted responsible sourcing programs that require us to meet certain environmental, social and governance criteria, and to periodically report on our performance against these requirements, including that we source the materials, supplies, and services we use and incorporate into the products we sell as prescribed by these programs. Many customer programs require us to remove a supplier within a prescribed period if such supplier ceases to comply with prescribed criteria, and our supply chain may at any time contain suppliers at risk of being removed due to non-compliance with responsible sourcing requirements. Some of our customers may elect to disqualify us as a supplier (resulting in a permanent or temporary loss of sales to such customer) or reduce purchases from us if we are unable to verify that our performance or products (including the underlying supply chain) meet the specifications of our customers’ responsible sourcing programs on a continuous basis. Meeting responsible sourcing requirements may increase operating requirements and costs or limit the sourcing and availability of some of the materials, supplies, and services we use, particularly when the availability of such materials, supplies, and services is concentrated to a limited number of suppliers. From time to time, we remove suppliers or require our suppliers to remove suppliers from their supply chains based on our responsible sourcing requirements or customer requirements, and we or our suppliers may be unable to replace such removed suppliers in a timely or cost-effective manner. Any inability to replace removed suppliers in a timely or cost effective manner may affect our ability and/or the cost to obtain sufficient quantities of materials, supplies, and services necessary for the manufacture of our products. Our inability to replace suppliers we have removed in a timely or cost-effective manner or comply with customers’ responsible sourcing requirements or with any related regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 47 | 2025 Q1 10-Q Table of Contents Failure to meet environmental, social, and governance expectations or standards or achieve our related goals could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or stock price. In recent years, there has been an increased focus from stakeholders on environmental, social, and governance matters, including greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related risks, sustainability, renewable energy, water stewardship, waste management, diversity, equality and inclusion, responsible sourcing and supply chain, human rights, and social responsibility. Given our commitment to social and environmental issues as it relates to our business, we actively manage these issues and have established and publicly announced certain goals, commitments, and targets which we may refine or even expand further in the future. These goals, commitments, and targets reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. Achieving these goals may entail significant costs, for example we have entered into several virtual power purchase agreements to obtain renewable energy credits at a cost that will vary based on future prices for electrical power. Evolving stakeholder expectations and our efforts to manage these issues, report on them, and accomplish our goals present numerous operational, regulatory, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks, any of which could have a material adverse impact, including on our reputation and stock price. Such risks and uncertainties include: • reputational harm, including damage to our relationships with customers, suppliers, investors, governments, or other stakeholders; • adverse impacts on our ability to manufacture and sell products and maintain our market share; • the success of our collaborations with third parties; • loss of business due to failure to meet our customers’ sustainability targets; • increased risk of litigation, investigations, or regulatory enforcement action; • unfavorable environmental, social, and governance ratings or investor sentiment; • diversion of resources and increased costs to control, assess, and report on environmental, social, and governance metrics; • our ability to achieve our goals, commitments, and targets within timeframes announced; • increased costs to achieve our goals, commitments, and targets; • unforeseen operational and technological difficulties; • access to and increased cost of capital; and • adverse impacts on our stock price. Any failure, or perceived failure, to meet evolving stakeholder expectations and industry standards or achieve our environmental, social, and governance goals, commitments, and targets could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or stock price. 48 Table of Contents Acquisitions and/or alliances involve numerous risks. Acquisitions and the formation or operation of alliances, such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements, involve numerous risks, including the following: • integrating the operations, technologies, and products of acquired or newly formed entities into our operations; • increasing capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain facilities; • increased debt levels; • the assumption of unknown or underestimated liabilities; • the use of cash to finance a transaction, which may reduce the availability of cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures, R&D expenditures, and other business activities; • diverting management’s attention from daily operations; • managing larger or more complex operations and facilities and employees in separate and diverse geographic areas; • hiring and retaining key employees; • requirements imposed by government authorities in connection with the regulatory review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures, imposition of significant obligations, or restrictions on the conduct of our business or the acquired business; • underestimating the costs or overestimating the benefits, including product, revenue, cost and other synergies and growth opportunities that we expect to realize, and we may not achieve those benefits; • failure to maintain customer, vendor, and other relationships; • inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company’s internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, compliance programs, and/or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices; and • impairment of acquired intangible assets, goodwill, or other assets as a result of changing business conditions or technological advancements. The global memory and storage industry has experienced consolidation and may continue to consolidate. We engage, from time to time, in discussions regarding potential acquisitions and similar opportunities. To the extent we are successful in completing any such transactions, we could be subject to some or all of the risks described above. Acquisitions of, or alliances with, technology companies are inherently risky and may not be successful and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. We may incur restructure charges in future periods and may not realize expected savings or other benefits from restructure plans. From time to time, we have because of the nature of our business, and may in the future, enter into restructure initiatives in order to, among other items, streamline our operations, respond to changes in business conditions, our markets, or product offerings, or to centralize certain key functions. We may not realize expected savings or other benefits from future restructure activities and may incur additional restructure charges or other losses in future periods associated with other initiatives. In connection with any restructure initiatives, we could incur restructure charges, loss of production output, loss of key personnel, disruptions in our operations, difficulties in the timely delivery of products, and loss of customers and local market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 49 | 2025 Q1 10-Q Table of Contents Risks Related to Intellectual Property and Litigation We may be unable to protect our intellectual property or retain key employees who are knowledgeable of and develop our intellectual property. We maintain a system of controls over our intellectual property, including U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, licensing arrangements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with employees, consultants, and vendors, and a general system of internal controls. Despite our system of controls over our intellectual property, it may be possible for our current or future competitors to obtain, copy, use, or disclose, illegally or otherwise, our product and process technology or other proprietary information. The laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same degree as do U.S. laws, and our confidentiality, non-disclosure, and non-compete agreements may be unenforceable or difficult and costly to enforce. The use of AI in the development of our products and services could also cause loss of intellectual property, as well as subject us to risks related to intellectual property infringement or misappropriation. Additionally, our ability to maintain and develop intellectual property is dependent upon our ability to attract, develop, and retain highly skilled employees. If our competitors or future entrants into our industry are successful in hiring our employees, they may directly benefit from the knowledge these employees gained while they were under our employment, and this may also negatively impact our ability to maintain and develop intellectual property. Our inability to protect our intellectual property or retain key employees who are knowledgeable of and develop our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Legal, regulatory and administrative investigations, inquiries, proceedings, and claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. From time to time, we are subject to various legal, regulatory and administrative investigations, inquiries, proceedings, and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business or otherwise, both domestically and internationally. Such claims, investigations, inquiries, and proceedings may include, but are not limited to, allegations of anticompetitive conduct and infringement of intellectual property. See “Part I. Financial Information – Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Contingencies.” We may be associated with and subject to litigation, claims, inquiries, investigations or disputes arising from, or as a result of: • our relationships with vendors or customers, supply agreements, or contractual obligations with our subcontractors or business partners; • the actions of our vendors, subcontractors, or business partners; • our indemnification obligations, including obligations to defend our customers against third-party claims asserting infringement of certain intellectual property rights, which may include patents, trademarks, copyrights, or trade secrets; and • the terms of our product warranties or from product liability claims. As we continue to focus on developing system solutions with manufacturers of consumer products, including autonomous driving, augmented reality, AI, and others, we may be exposed to greater potential for personal liability claims against us as a result of consumers’ use of those products. We, our officers, or our directors could also be subject to claims of alleged violations of securities laws. Expansion of our production capacity in the United States and in other regions is subject to inherent safety risks for our employees and contractors. This expansion activity may involve accidents, which could result in project delays, litigation, claims or disputes by our contractors and others, as well as increased insurance costs. 50 Table of Contents While the risks of our construction projects are covered by insurance and contractual indemnities from our contractors, we may not have insurance coverage or rights to indemnity for all risks. Further, there can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities, and we may elect to self-insure with respect to certain matters. Exposures to various legal proceedings and claims, with or without merit, could require significant attention from our management and could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend claims, are required to pay damage awards, or enter into settlement agreements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Claims that our products or manufacturing processes infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others, or failure to obtain or renew license agreements covering such intellectual property, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. As is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries, from time to time others have asserted, and may in the future assert, that our products or manufacturing processes infringe upon, misappropriate, misuse, or otherwise violate their intellectual property rights. We are unable to predict the outcome of these assertions made against us. Any of these types of claims, regardless of the merits, could subject us to significant costs to defend or resolve such claims and may consume a substantial portion of management’s time and attention. As a result of these claims, we may be required to: • pay significant monetary damages, fines, royalties, or penalties; • enter into license or settlement agreements covering such intellectual property rights; • make material changes to or redesign our products and/or manufacturing processes; and/or • cease manufacturing, having made, selling, offering for sale, importing, marketing, or using products and/or manufacturing processes in certain jurisdictions. We may not be able to take any of the actions described above on commercially reasonable terms and any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. See “Part I. Financial Information – Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Contingencies.” We have a number of intellectual property license agreements. Some of these license agreements require us to make one-time or periodic payments. We may need to obtain additional licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future. We are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on terms acceptable to us. The failure to obtain or renew licenses as necessary could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Risks Related to Laws and Regulations Government actions and regulations, such as export restrictions, tariffs, and trade protection measures, may limit our ability to sell our products to certain customers or markets, or could otherwise restrict our ability to conduct operations. International trade disputes, geopolitical tensions, and military conflicts have led, and continue to lead, to new and increasing export restrictions, trade barriers, tariffs, and other trade measures that can increase our manufacturing costs, make our products less competitive, reduce demand for our products, limit our ability to sell to certain customers or markets, limit our ability to procure, or increase our costs for, components or raw materials, impede or slow the movement of our goods across borders, impede our ability to perform R&D activities, or otherwise restrict our ability to conduct operations. Government actions in the United States or abroad may lead to further changes in trade policy, domestic sourcing initiatives, increases in foreign government incentives supporting domestic businesses or other formal and informal measures that could make it more difficult to sell our products in, or restrict our access to, some markets and/or customers. For example, following the May 2023 decision of its cybersecurity review of our products sold in China, the CAC determined that critical information infrastructure operators in China may not purchase Micron products, impacting our revenue with companies headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong, including direct sales as well as indirect sales through distributors. Further actions by the Chinese government, through CAC action or other means, could impact revenue inside or outside China, or our operations in China, or our ability to ship products to our customers, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 51 | 2025 Q1 10-Q Table of Contents We cannot predict what actions may be taken with respect to export regulations, tariffs, or other trade regulations between the United States and other countries, what products or companies may be subject to such actions, or what actions may be taken by other countries in retaliation. Further changes in trade policy, tariffs, restrictions on exports or other trade barriers, or restrictions on supplies, equipment, and raw materials including rare earth minerals, may limit our ability to produce products, increase our selling and/or manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies. For example, increasing geopolitical tensions have in the past and could in the future result in new export controls associated with products, including those that support or enable AI applications, which could, in turn, restrict future sales of certain products to China or other markets. Such changes may also result in reputational harm to us, the development or adoption of technologies that compete with our products, long-term changes in global trade and technology supply chains, or negative impacts on our customers’ products which incorporate our solutions. Any of the effects described in this risk factor could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. The technology industry is subject to intense media, political, and regulatory scrutiny, which can increase our exposure to government investigations, legal actions, and penalties. Although we have policies, controls, and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, or agents will not violate such laws or our policies. Violations of trade laws, restrictions, or regulations can result in fines; criminal sanctions against us or our officers, directors, or employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. Tax-related matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes and cash tax liabilities in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including changes in the geographic mix of our earnings among jurisdictions, challenges by tax authorities to our tax positions and intercompany transfer pricing arrangements, failure to meet performance obligations with respect to tax incentive agreements, expanding our operations in various countries, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, adverse resolution of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns, and changes in tax laws and regulations. Changes to income tax laws and regulations, or the interpretation of such laws, in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could significantly increase our effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flows from operating activities and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project, including Pillar Two Model Rules (“Pillar Two”), undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”). Nearly all European Union member states have enacted the Pillar Two legislation, which will be effective for us in 2025. We do not expect these enacted laws to materially impact our effective tax rate for 2025. On November 27, 2024, Singapore enacted legislation to implement Pillar Two, which will apply to us starting in 2026. While we are still evaluating the impacts, we expect our effective tax rate for 2026 to be in the high-teens percentage range. We also continue to monitor for additional guidance and legislative changes related to Pillar Two in the jurisdictions where we operate. We and others are subject to a variety of complex and evolving laws, regulations, or industry standards, including with respect to environmental, health, safety, and product considerations, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. The manufacture of our products requires the use of facilities, equipment, chemicals, and materials that are subject to a broad array of laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions in which we operate. This includes increasing regulations on a class of chemicals known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Additionally, we are subject to a variety of other laws and regulations relative to the construction, maintenance, and operations of our facilities. Any changes in laws, regulations, or industry standards could cause us to incur additional direct costs, as well as increased indirect costs related to our relationships with our customers and suppliers, and otherwise harm our operations and financial condition. Any failure to comply with laws, regulations, or industry standards could adversely impact our reputation and our financial results. Additionally, we engage various third parties as sales channel partners or to represent us or otherwise act on our behalf who are also subject to a broad array of laws, regulations, and industry standards. Our engagement with these third parties may also expose us to risks associated with their respective compliance with laws and regulations. 52 Table of Contents New and evolving environmental health, safety, and product considerations, including those related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, the purchase, use and disposal of regulated and/or hazardous chemicals, and the potential resulting environmental, health or safety impacts, may result in new laws, regulations, or industry standards that may affect us, our suppliers, and our customers. Such laws, regulations, or industry standards could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers, or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. New and evolving laws and regulations relating to cybersecurity, data privacy, and AI impose requirements for information confidentiality, integrity, availability, personal and proprietary data collection, storage, use, sharing, deletion, and AI systems to be appropriately transparent, fair, secure, beneficial, and accountable. Such laws, standards, and market expectations could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers, or partners reluctance to share information or solutions due to actual or perceived inadequate controls. These costs may adversely impact our operations and financial condition. As a result of the considerations detailed in this risk factor, we could experience the following: • suspension of production or sales of our products; • limited supplies of chemicals or materials used to make our products; • remediation costs; • increased compliance costs; • alteration of our manufacturing processes; • regulatory penalties, fines, civil or criminal sanctions, and other legal liabilities; and • reputational challenges. Compliance with, or our failure, or the failure of our third-party sales channel partners or agents, to comply with, laws, regulations, or industry standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Risks Related to Capitalization and Financial Markets We may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations, make scheduled debt payments, pay our dividend, and make adequate capital investments. Our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory and storage products sold, average selling prices, and manufacturing costs. To develop new product and process technology, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality, we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology, capital equipment, facilities, R&D, and product and process technology. We estimate capital expenditures in 2025 for property, plant, and equipment, net of proceeds from government incentives, to be approximately $14 billion plus or minus $500 million. In the past, we have utilized external sources of financing when needed. As a result of our debt levels, expected debt amortization, prevailing interest rates, and general capital market and other economic conditions, it may be difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. We have experienced volatility in our cash flows and operating results and we expect to continue to experience such volatility in the future, which may negatively affect our credit rating. Our credit rating may also be affected by our liquidity, financial results, economic risk, or other factors, which may increase the cost of borrowings and make it difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. There can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows, access capital or credit markets, or find other sources of financing to fund our operations, make debt payments, refinance our debt, pay our quarterly dividend, and make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency. Our inability to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 53 | 2025 Q1 10-Q Table of Contents Debt obligations could adversely affect our financial condition. We have incurred in the past, and expect to incur in the future, debt to finance our capital investments, business acquisitions, and to realign our capital structure. As of November 28, 2024, we had debt with a carrying value of $13.79 billion and may incur additional debt, including under our $2.50 billion Revolving Credit Facility. Our debt obligations could adversely impact us as follows: • require us to use a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on debt, which will reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund our business activities; • adversely impact our credit rating, which could increase borrowing costs and reduce our ability to raise funds on favorable terms; • limit our future ability to raise funds for capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, R&D, and other general corporate requirements; • restrict our ability to incur specified indebtedness, create or incur certain liens, and enter into sale-leaseback financing transactions; • increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; • increase our exposure to rising interest rates from variable rate indebtedness; and • result in certain of our debt instruments becoming immediately due and payable or being deemed to be in default if applicable cross default, cross-acceleration and/or similar provisions are triggered. Our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flows or obtain external financing in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to market, economic, financial, competitive, legislative, and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that additional capital will be available to us, in amounts sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs. Additionally, events and circumstances may occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy applicable draw-down conditions and utilize our Revolving Credit Facility. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows to service our debt payment obligations or satisfy our debt covenants, we may need to refinance, restructure, or amend the terms of our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Across our global operations, significant transactions and balances are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (our reporting currency), primarily the Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, euro, Indian rupee, Japanese yen, Malaysian ringgit, New Taiwan dollar, and Singapore dollar. In addition, a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in some of the foreign currencies mentioned above. Exchange rates for some of these currencies against the U.S. dollar have been volatile and may be volatile in future periods. If these currencies strengthen against the U.S. dollar, our manufacturing costs could significantly increase. Exchange rates for the U.S. dollar that adversely change against our foreign currency exposures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. We are subject to counterparty default risks. We have numerous arrangements with financial institutions that subject us to counterparty default risks, including cash deposits, investments, and derivative instruments. Additionally, we are subject to counterparty default risk from our customers for amounts receivable from them. As a result, we are subject to the risk that the counterparty will default on its performance obligations. A counterparty may not comply with its contractual commitments which could then lead to its defaulting on its obligations with little or no notice to us, which could limit our ability to mitigate our exposure. Additionally, our ability to mitigate our exposures may be constrained by the terms of our contractual arrangements or because market conditions prevent us from taking effective action. If one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterparty’s default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of such default, we could incur significant losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 54 Table of Contents The trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. Our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, we, the technology industry, and the stock market as a whole have on occasion experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to the specific operating performance of individual companies. The trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely due to various factors, including, but not limited to, actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results, changes in financial forecasts or estimates by us or financial or other market estimates and ratings by securities and other analysts, changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public, interest rate changes, regulatory changes, news regarding our products or products of our competitors, and broad market and industry fluctuations. For these reasons, investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future trading prices of our common stock, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Investors in our common stock may not realize any return on their investment in us and may lose some or all of their investment. Volatility in the trading price of our common stock could also result in the filing of securities class action litigation matters, which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources. The amount and frequency of our share repurchases may fluctuate, and we cannot guarantee that we will purchase all of the shares under our share repurchase authorization, or that it will enhance long-term shareholder value. Share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and will diminish our cash reserves. The amount, frequency, and execution of our share repurchases pursuant to our share repurchase authorization may fluctuate based on our operating results, cash flows, restrictions applicable under our CHIPS Act direct funding agreements, and priorities for the use of cash for other purposes. See “Part I. Financial Information –Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – CHIPS Act Funding Agreements.” Our expenditures for these share repurchases were $300 million in 2024, $425 million in 2023, $2.43 billion in 2022, $1.20 billion in 2021, $176 million in 2020, and $2.66 billion in 2019. These other purposes include, but are not limited to, operational spending, capital spending, acquisitions, and repayment of debt. Other factors, including changes in tax laws, could also impact our share repurchases. Although our Board of Directors has authorized share repurchases of up to $10 billion of our outstanding common stock, the authorization does not obligate us to repurchase any common stock. We cannot guarantee that we will purchase all of the shares under our share repurchase authorization or that it will enhance long-term shareholder value. The repurchase authorization could affect the trading price of our stock and increase volatility, and any announcement of a pause in, or termination of, this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock. In addition, this program is a use of cash, which may reduce the availability of cash for other business purposes, including investments, acquisitions, dividends, or repayment of indebtedness. There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends in any particular amounts or at all. Our Board of Directors has adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which we currently pay a cash dividend on our common shares on a quarterly basis. The declaration and payment of any dividend is subject to the approval of our Board of Directors and our dividend may be discontinued or reduced at any time. There can be no assurance that we will declare cash dividends in the future in any particular amounts, or at all. Future dividends, if any, and their timing and amount, may be affected by, among other factors: our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions, debt service obligations, contractual restrictions, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. A reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock. In addition, the payment of dividends is a use of cash, which may reduce the availability of cash for other business purposes, including investments, acquisitions, or repayment of indebtedness. 55 | 2025 Q1 10-Q Table of Contents ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS In May 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to $10 billion of our outstanding common stock through open-market purchases, block trades, privately-negotiated transactions, derivative transactions, and/or pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date, does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, and is subject to market conditions, restrictions applicable under our CHIPS Act direct funding agreements, and our ongoing determination of the best use of available cash. See “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – CHIPS Act Funding Agreements.” During the quarter ended November 28, 2024, we did not repurchase any common stock under the authorization and as of November 28, 2024, $2.81 billion of the authorization remained available for the repurchase of our common stock. Shares of common stock withheld as payment of withholding taxes upon the vesting of restricted stock are also treated as common stock repurchases. Shares withheld as payment of withholding taxes upon the vesting of restricted stock units are not considered repurchases for purposes of this Item and are not required to be reported. In the first quarter of 2025, shares withheld as payment upon the vesting of restricted stock consisted of the following: Period Total number of shares purchased Average price paid per share Total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced plans or programs Approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under publicly announced plans or programs (in millions) August 30, 2024 – September 26, 2024 — $ — — September 27, 2024 – October 24, 2024 166,136 107.14 — October 25, 2024 – November 28, 2024 — — — 166,136 $ 107.14 — $2,806 ITEM 5.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (All tabular amounts in millions, except per share amounts) (Unaudited) Significant Accounting Policies For a discussion of our significant accounting policies, see “Part II. – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Significant Accounting Policies” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 29, 2024. There have been no changes to our significant accounting policies since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 29, 2024. Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Micron Technology, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) consistent in all material respects with those applied in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 29, 2024. In the opinion of our management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all necessary adjustments, consisting of a normal recurring nature, to fairly state the financial information set forth herein. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to current period presentation. Our fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period ending on the Thursday closest to August 31. Fiscal years 2025 and 2024 each contain 52 weeks. All period references are to our fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated. These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 29, 2024. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07 (ASC Topic 280), Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures . This ASU expands on existing reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. This ASU will be effective for our annual reporting for 2025 on a retrospective basis. Adoption of this new guidance will result in increased disclosures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 (ASC Topic 740), Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures . This ASU requires disaggregated income tax disclosures on the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. This ASU will be effective for our annual reporting for 2026 on a prospective basis, with retrospective application permitted. Adoption of this new guidance will result in increased disclosures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03 (ASC Topic 220), Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses . This ASU requires disclosure of certain expenses in the notes to the financial statements. This ASU will be effective for our annual reporting for 2028 on a prospective basis, with retrospective application permitted. Adoption of this new guidance will result in increased disclosures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 11 | 2025 Q2 10-Q Table of Contents Variable Interest Entities Certain third-party special purpose entities (the \"Lease SPEs\") facilitate equipment lease financing transactions between us and various financial institutions. Neither we nor the financial institutions have an equity interest in the Lease SPEs, which are variable interest entities. The arrangements are financing vehicles and we do not bear any significant risks from variable interests with the Lease SPEs. We do not direct the activities of the Lease SPEs that most significantly impact their economic performance and, as such, we do not consolidate them. As of February 27, 2025, we had approximately $ 1.38 billion of finance lease liabilities and right-of-use assets under these arrangements. Cash and Investments All of our short-term investments and long-term marketable investments were classified as available-for-sale as of the dates noted below. Cash and equivalents and the fair values of our available-for-sale investments, which approximated amortized costs, were as follows: As of February 27, 2025 As of August 29, 2024 Cash and Equivalents Short-term Investments Long-term Marketable Investments (1) Total Fair Value Cash and Equivalents Short-term Investments Long-term Marketable Investments (1) Total Fair Value Cash $ 7,334 $ — $ — $ 7,334 $ 6,654 $ — $ — $ 6,654 Level 1 (2) Money market funds 17 — — 17 20 — — 20 Level 2 (3) Certificates of deposit 147 6 — 153 316 6 — 322 Corporate bonds — 520 880 1,400 — 771 571 1,342 Asset-backed securities — 28 430 458 — 46 433 479 Government securities 23 51 65 139 35 82 42 159 Commercial paper 31 58 — 89 16 160 — 176 7,552 $ 663 $ 1,375 $ 9,590 7,041 $ 1,065 $ 1,046 $ 9,152 Restricted cash (4) 11 11 Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 7,563 $ 7,052 (1) The maturities of long-term marketable investments primarily range from one to five years , except for asset-backed securities which are not due at a single maturity date. (2) The fair value of Level 1 securities is measured based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. (3) The fair value of Level 2 securities is measured using information obtained from pricing services, which obtain quoted market prices for similar instruments, non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data, or various other methodologies, to determine the appropriate value at the measurement date. We perform supplemental analysis to validate information obtained from these pricing services. No adjustments were made to the fair values indicated by such pricing information as of February 27, 2025 or August 29, 2024. (4) Restricted cash is included in other current assets and primarily relates to certain government incentives received prior to being earned and for which restrictions lapse upon achieving certain performance conditions or which will be returned if performance conditions are not met. Gross realized gains and losses from sales of available-for-sale securities were not significant for any period presented. 12 Table of Contents Non-marketable Equity Investments In addition to the amounts included in the table above, we had $ 196 million and $ 190 million of non-marketable equity investments without a readily determinable fair value that were included in other noncurrent assets as of February 27, 2025 and August 29, 2024, respectively. For non-marketable investments, we recognized in other non-operating income (expense) a net loss of $ 31 million for the first six months of 2024. The amounts recognized for the other periods presented were not significant. Our non-marketable equity investments are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis and classified as Level 3.

The resulting variable interest paid is at a rate equal to SOFR plus approximately 3.33 %. The fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges, and as a result, the carrying values of our 2027 Notes reflect adjustments in fair value. Debt Activity The table below presents the effects of debt financing and prepayment activities in the first six months of 2025: Transaction Date Increase (Decrease) in Principal Increase (Decrease) in Carrying Value Increase (Decrease) in Cash Issuances 2035 Notes January 16, 2025 $ 1,000 $ 992 $ 992 2029 Term Loan A January 17, 2025 1,684 1,681 1,681 Prepayments 2026 Notes February 12, 2025 ( 500 ) ( 499 ) ( 501 ) 2026 Term Loan A January 17, 2025 ( 897 ) ( 896 ) ( 897 ) 2027 Term Loan A January 17, 2025 ( 1,037 ) ( 1,035 ) ( 1,037 ) $ 250 $ 243 $ 238 2035 Notes On January 16, 2025, we issued $ 1.00 billion principal amount of senior unsecured 2035 Notes in a public offering. The 2035 Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.80 % per year and will mature on January 15, 2035. 16 Table of Contents Prior to October 15, 2034 (the “Par Call Date”), we may redeem the 2035 Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100 % of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed and (ii) the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest, plus, in each case, accrued interest. On or after the Par Call Date, we may redeem the 2035 Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100 % of the principal amount of the 2035 Notes to be redeemed plus accrued interest. The 2035 Notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit, in certain circumstances, our ability and/or the ability of our restricted subsidiaries (which are generally domestic subsidiaries in which we own at least 80 % of the voting stock and which own principal property, as defined in the indenture governing the 2035 Notes) to (1) create or incur certain liens; (2) enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions with respect to any principal property; and (3) consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer, or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets, to another entity. These covenants are subject to a number of limitations and exceptions. Additionally, if a change of control triggering event occurs, as defined in the indenture governing the 2035 Notes, we will be required to offer to repurchase the 2035 Notes at a price equal to 101 % of the principal amount plus accrued interest up to the repurchase date. 2029 Term Loan A On January 17, 2025, we entered into a term loan agreement and borrowed $ 1.68 billion in principal amount due January 17, 2029 (the “Term Loan Agreement”). Borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement will generally bear interest at adjusted term SOFR plus an applicable interest rate margin ranging from 0.875 % to 1.50 %, depending on our corporate credit ratings. The Term Loan Agreement requires us to maintain, on a consolidated basis, a net leverage ratio of total net indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the Term Loan Agreement and calculated as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, not to exceed 3.25 to 1.00, subject to a temporary four fiscal quarter increase in such maximum ratio to 3.75 to 1.00 following certain material acquisitions. Our obligations under the Term Loan Agreement are unsecured. Revolving Credit Facility On March 12, 2025, we terminated our existing undrawn credit facility and entered into a new five -year unsecured Revolving Credit Facility. Under the Revolving Credit Facility, we can draw up to $ 3.50 billion which would generally bear interest at a rate equal to adjusted term SOFR plus 0.875 % to 1.50 %, depending on our corporate credit ratings. Any amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility would mature on March 12, 2030 and amounts borrowed may be prepaid without penalty. The Revolving Credit Facility contains the same net leverage ratio and substantially the same other covenants as the Term Loan Agreement. Maturities of Notes Payable and Term Loans As of February 27, 2025, maturities of notes payable and term loans by fiscal year were as follows: Remainder of 2025 $ — 2026 — 2027 900 2028 600 2029 2,384 2030 and thereafter 7,750 Unamortized issuance costs, discounts, and premium, net ( 41 ) Hedge accounting fair value adjustment ( 52 ) $ 11,541 17 | 2025 Q2 10-Q Table of Contents Contingencies We are currently a party to legal actions other than those described below arising from the normal course of business, none of which are expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Patent Matters As is typical in the semiconductor and other high-tech industries, from time to time, others have asserted, and may in the future assert, that our products or manufacturing processes infringe upon their intellectual property rights. A description of certain claims is below. On April 28, 2021, Netlist, Inc. (“Netlist”) filed two patent infringement actions against Micron, Micron Semiconductor Products, Inc. (“MSP”), and Micron Technology Texas, LLC (“MTEC”) in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. The first complaint alleges that one U.S. patent is infringed by certain of our non-volatile dual in-line memory modules. The second complaint alleges that three U.S. patents are infringed by certain of our load-reduced dual in-line memory modules (“LRDIMMs”). Each complaint seeks injunctive relief, damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. On March 31, 2022, Netlist filed a patent infringement complaint against Micron and Micron Semiconductor Germany, GmbH in Dusseldorf Regional Court alleging that two German patents are infringed by certain of our LRDIMMs. The complaint seeks damages, costs, and injunctive relief. In rulings issued on March 7, 2024 and November 7, 2024, the Federal Patent Court in Germany declared both patents invalid. Netlist has appealed those rulings. On June 10, 2022, Netlist filed a patent infringement complaint against Micron, MSP, and MTEC in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (“E.D. Tex.”) alleging that six U.S. patents are infringed by certain of our memory modules and HBM products. On August 1, 2022, Netlist filed a second patent infringement complaint against the same defendants in E.D. Tex. alleging that one U.S. patent is infringed by certain of our LRDIMMs. On August 15, 2022, Netlist amended the second complaint to assert that two additional U.S. patents are infringed by certain of our LRDIMMs. The complaints in E.D. Tex. seek injunctive relief, damages, and attorneys’ fees. On May 23, 2024, following a four-day trial regarding the second complaint filed by Netlist in the E.D. Tex., a jury rendered a verdict that Micron’s memory modules infringe two asserted patents — U.S. Patent No. 7,619,912 (“the ‘912 patent”) and U.S. Patent No. 11,093,417 (“the ‘417 patent”) — and found that Micron should pay $ 425 million for infringement of the ‘912 patent and $ 20 million for infringement of the ‘417 patent. Micron expects to appeal the verdict. On April 17, 2024, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”) of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) issued a final written decision (“FWD”) finding unpatentable the sole asserted claim of the ‘912 patent. On September 10, 2024, Netlist filed a notice that it will appeal the ruling that the ‘912 patent is invalid to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (“Federal Circuit”). On July 30, 2024, the USPTO issued a FWD finding unpatentable all asserted claims of the ‘417 patent. On December 10, 2024, Netlist filed a notice that it will appeal the ruling that the ‘417 patent is invalid to the Federal Circuit. In the case of each of the ‘912 and ‘417 patents, if the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirms the FWD, then the affirmed FWD will preclude any pending actions asserting infringement of such patent (including any infringement verdict that is subject to an ongoing appeal). On January 23, 2023, Besang Inc. filed a patent infringement complaint against Micron in the U.S. District Court for the E.D. Tex. The complaint alleges that one U.S. patent is infringed by certain of our 3D NAND and SSD products. The complaint seeks an injunction, damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. 18 Table of Contents On November 9, 2023, Yangtze Memory Technologies Company, Ltd. (“YMTC”) filed a patent infringement complaint against Micron and one of its subsidiaries in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (“N.D. Cal.”). The complaint alleges that eight U.S. patents are infringed by certain of our 3D NAND products. The complaint seeks an injunction, damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. On January 22, 2024, Micron Semiconductor (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. (“MSS”) was served with three patent infringement complaints filed by YMTC in Beijing Intellectual Property Court and on February 27, 2024, Micron Technology, Inc. (“MTI”) was served with the same complaints. The complaints assert that MTI and MSS infringed three Chinese patents owned by YMTC by importing, selling, offering for sale, and assisting others to sell certain 3D NAND products and SSDs in China. The complaint seeks an injunction, damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. On July 12, 2024, YMTC filed a second complaint against Micron and its subsidiary in N.D. Cal. The second complaint alleges that eleven U.S. patents are infringed by certain of our 3D NAND and DDR5 DRAM products. The complaint seeks an injunction, damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. On September 11, 2024, MSS was served with five patent infringement complaints filed by YMTC in Shanghai Intellectual Property Court. The complaints assert that MTI and MSS infringed five Chinese patents owned by YMTC by importing, selling, offering for sale, and assisting others to sell certain 3D NAND products and SSDs in China. The complaint seeks an injunction, damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. On October 16, 2024, Palisade Technologies, LLP filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Micron and MSP in the U.S. District Court for the W.D. Tex. The complaint alleges that five U.S. patents are infringed by certain of our DRAM, NAND, 3D NAND, and SSD products. The complaint seeks an injunction, damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. The above lawsuits pertain to substantially all of our DRAM, NAND, and other memory and storage products we manufacture, which account for substantially all of our revenue. Securities Class Action Matters On January 9, 2025, a putative class action complaint was filed against Micron and certain individual officers in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida for alleged violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaint alleges defendants made materially false or misleading statements during a putative class period from September 18, 2024 to December 18, 2024, regarding the demand for Micron's products, particularly NAND and consumer-oriented products. The complaint seeks unspecified compensatory damages, attorneys' fees and costs. Shareholder Derivative Matters On February 20, 2025, a shareholder derivative complaint was filed by a purported shareholder against certain individual directors and officers of Micron, allegedly on behalf of and for the benefit of Micron, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho. On February 21, 2025, a similar related derivative complaint was filed by another purported shareholder in the same court against certain individual directors and officers of Micron. The complaints allege violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider trading, abuse of control, and waste of corporate assets. The complaints are based on substantially the same allegedly false or misleading statements asserted in the securities class action matter. The complaints seek various unspecified damages allegedly suffered by Micron, restitution, attorneys' fees and costs and other relief, including reforms and improvements to our corporate governance and internal procedures. Antitrust Matters On May 15, 2018, the Chinese State Administration for Market Regulation (“SAMR”) notified Micron that it was investigating potential collusion and other anticompetitive conduct by DRAM suppliers in China. On May 31, 2018, SAMR made unannounced visits to our sales offices in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen to seek certain information as part of its investigation. We are cooperating with SAMR in its investigation. 19 | 2025 Q2 10-Q Table of Contents Other Matters In the normal course of business, we are a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify another party. It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these types of agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, our payments under these types of agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Contingency Assessment We ar e unable to predict the outcome of any of the matters noted above and cannot make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of possible losses. A determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others or entering into a license agreement covering such intellectual property could result in significant liability and/or require us to make material changes to our products and/or manufacturing processes. Any of the foregoing, as well as the resolution of any other legal matter noted above, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Equity Common Stock Repurchases Our Board of Directors has authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to $ 10 billion of our outstanding common stock through open-market purchases, block trades, privately-negotiated transactions, derivative transactions, and/or pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date, does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, and is subject to market conditions, restrictions applicable under our CHIPS Act direct funding agreements, and our ongoing determination of the best use of available cash. See “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – CHIPS Act Funding Agreements.” No shares were repurchased in the first six months of 2025. Through February 27, 2025, we had repurchased an aggregate of $ 7.19 billion under the authorization. Amounts repurchased are included in treasury stock. Dividends We declared and paid dividends of $ 0.115 per share in the first and second quarters of 2025. On March 20, 2025, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $ 0.115 per share, payable in cash on April 15, 2025 , to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 31, 2025 . 20 Table of Contents Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by component for the six months ended February 27, 2025 were as follows: Gains (Losses) on Derivative Instruments Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Investments Pension Liability Adjustments Cumulative Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment Total As of August 29, 2024 $ ( 162 ) $ ( 8 ) $ 39 $ ( 3 ) $ ( 134 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ( 127 ) 1 — — ( 126 ) Amount reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 74 — ( 2 ) — 72 Tax effects ( 3 ) ( 1 ) 1 — ( 3 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) ( 56 ) — ( 1 ) — ( 57 ) As of February 27, 2025 $ ( 218 ) $ ( 8 ) $ 38 $ ( 3 ) $ ( 191 ) Fair Value Measurements The estimated fair values and carrying values of our outstanding debt instruments were as follows: As of February 27, 2025 As of August 29, 2024 Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Notes payable and term loans $ 11,413 $ 11,541 $ 11,316 $ 11,343 The fair values of our debt instruments were estimated based on Level 2 inputs, including the trading price of our notes when available, discounted cash flows, and interest rates based on similar debt issued by parties with credit ratings similar to ours. 21 | 2025 Q2 10-Q Table of Contents Derivative Instruments Notional or Contractual Amount Fair Value (1) of Assets (2) Liabilities (3) As of February 27, 2025 Derivative instruments with hedge accounting designation Cash flow currency hedges $ 3,937 $ 11 $ ( 91 ) Cash flow commodity hedges 465 12 ( 14 ) Fair value currency hedges 2,457 18 — Fair value interest rate hedges 900 — ( 53 ) Derivative instruments without hedge accounting designation Non-designated currency hedges 2,887 28 ( 5 ) $ 69 $ ( 163 ) As of August 29, 2024 Derivative instruments with hedge accounting designation Cash flow currency hedges $ 3,724 $ 57 $ ( 71 ) Cash flow commodity hedges 471 20 ( 7 ) Fair value currency hedges 2,511 — ( 41 ) Fair value interest rate hedges 900 — ( 60 ) Derivative instruments without hedge accounting designation Non-designated currency hedges 2,393 18 ( 3 ) $ 95 $ ( 182 ) (1) Forward and swap contracts are measured at fair value based on market-based observable inputs including market spot and forward rates, interest rates, and credit-risk spreads (Level 2). (2) Included in receivables and other noncurrent assets. (3) Included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other noncurrent liabilities. Derivative Instruments with Hedge Accounting Designation Cash Flow Hedges : We utilize forward and swap contracts that generally mature within two years designated as cash flow hedges to minimize our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates or commodity prices for certain capital expenditures and manufacturing costs. The effects of cash flow hedging activities were as follows: Quarter Ended Six months ended February 27, 2025 February 29, 2024 February 27, 2025 February 29, 2024 Gain (loss) from cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) $ 17 $ ( 45 ) $ ( 116 ) $ ( 43 ) Gain (loss) excluded from effectiveness testing in cost of goods sold ( 27 ) ( 34 ) ( 56 ) ( 70 ) Gain (loss) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings, primarily to cost of goods sold ( 34 ) ( 56 ) ( 74 ) ( 100 ) As of February 27, 2025, we expect to reclassify $ 102 million of pre-tax losses related to cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings in the next 12 months. 22 Table of Contents Fair Value Hedges : We utilize currency forward contracts that generally mature within one year designated as fair value hedges to minimize our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates for non-U.S.-dollar-denominated cash and investments in debt securities. The fair value of our hedged cash and investments in debt securities was $ 2.43 billion as of February 27, 2025. The changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as fair value hedges and the offsetting changes in the underlying fair values of the hedged items are both recognized in earnings. We recognized gains of $ 49 million and $ 145 million for the second quarter and first six months of 2025, respectively, for changes in the fair values of our fair value currency hedges and offsetting losses of $ 42 million and $ 139 million for the second quarter and first six months of 2025, respectively, for changes in the underlying fair values of the hedged items in other non-operating income (expense). The effects of the fair value currency hedges and the hedged items were not significant for the other periods presented. We also utilize fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges to minimize certain exposures to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt that result from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates. The effects of fair value hedges on our consolidated statements of operations, recognized in interest expense, were not significant for the periods presented. Derivative Instruments without Hedge Accounting Designation Currency Derivatives : We generally utilize a rolling hedge strategy with currency forward contracts that mature within three months to hedge our exposures of monetary assets and liabilities from changes in currency exchange rates. At the end of each reporting period, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are remeasured into U.S. dollars and the associated outstanding forward contracts are marked to market. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments without hedge accounting designation as well as the changes in the underlying monetary assets and liabilities from changes in currency exchange rates are included in other non-operating income (expense), net. We recognized losses of $ 12 million and $ 68 million for derivative instruments without hedge accounting designation for the second quarter and first six months of 2025, respectively. The amounts recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for the other periods presented were not significant. We do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes. Equity Compensation Plans As of February 27, 2025, 57 million shares of our common stock were available for future awards under our equity compensation plans, including 9 million shares approved for issuance under our employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”).

Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Segment and Other Information” for disclosure of disaggregated revenue by market segment. Revenue is primarily recognized at a point in time when control of the promised goods is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods. Substantially all contracts with our customers are short-term in duration at fixed, negotiated prices with payment generally due shortly after delivery. From time to time, we have contracts with initial terms that include performance obligations that extend beyond one year. As of February 27, 2025, our future performance obligations beyond one year were $ 142 million, which included customer prepayments and other contract liabilities. As of February 27, 2025 and August 29, 2024, customer prepayments made to secure product supply in future periods and other contract liabilities were $ 555 million and $ 907 million, respectively, of which $ 413 million and $ 766 million were reported in other current liabilities, respectively. The remainder of the customer prepayments and other contract liabilities were in other noncurrent liabilities. Revenue recognized during the first six months of 2025 from the beginning balance as of August 29, 2024 included $ 365 million from shipments against customer prepayments and other contract liabilities. As of February 27, 2025 and August 29, 2024, other current liabilities included $ 756 million and $ 718 million, respectively, for estimates of consideration payable to customers including estimates for pricing adjustments and returns.

Beginning in the second quarter of 2024, we were able to estimate a more reliable annual effective tax rate and reverted to a global annual effective tax rate method for all jurisdictions. Applying this updated rate to our year-to-date earnings resulted in the tax benefit of $ 622 million recognized in the second quarter of 2024. The change in our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2025 as compared to the second quarter of 2024 was primarily due to changes in profitability and the aforementioned calculation of our tax expense in the second quarter of 2024. The change in our effective tax rate for the first six months of 2025 as compared to the first six months of 2024 was primarily due to changes in profitability. We operate in a number of jurisdictions outside the United States, including Singapore, where we have tax incentive arrangements. These incentives expire, in whole or in part, at various dates through 2034 and are conditional, in part, upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds. The effect of tax incentive arrangements reduced our tax provision by $ 171 million (benefiting our diluted earnings per share by $ 0.15 ) and $ 383 million (benefiting our diluted earnings per share by $ 0.34 ) for the second quarter and first six months of 2025, respectively. As a result of the low level of profitability and geographic mix of income, the benefit from tax incentive arrangements was not material for the second quarter and first six months of 2024.

CHIPS Act Funding Agreements On December 9, 2024, we entered into direct funding agreements with the U.S. Department of Commerce for up to $ 6.1 billion in direct funding pursuant to the CHIPS Act for a planned fab in Boise, Idaho and two planned fabs in Clay, New York. Funding will be based on the achievement of construction, tool installation, and wafer production milestones. We retain discretion with respect to capacity and production volume ramp of each project. The agreements contain representations, warranties, and covenants that relate to compliance with requirements for awards provided for in the CHIPS Act. In addition, the agreements include certain events of default and related rights and remedies, including clawbacks related to the failure to complete a project by an agreed upon completion date, violation of CHIPS Act restrictions on certain activities involving foreign countries and entities of concern, and impermissible use or disposition of a project. We are permitted to make customary and ordinary course recurring dividends (and reasonable ordinary course increases thereof) consistent with our past practice. There are restrictions on our payment of special and one-time dividends during the five-year period following the award date of December 9, 2024. Share repurchases are permitted during the first two years of such five-year period up to amounts specified in the funding agreements to help offset the dilutive effects of employee stock compensation or as otherwise permitted by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Share repurchases are not restricted during the final three years of such five-year period if certain financial and other conditions are satisfied. We may be required to pay upside sharing amounts for a period of up to ten years following the first year in which the cumulative cash flow from a project is positive, if cumulative cash flows from the project exceed a threshold level that is at a significant premium to the baseline projection. The upside sharing amount would equal a modest sharing percentage of the excess cash flows above the threshold level, but not to exceed 75% of award disbursements for a project, after considering any clawbacks or other repayments. On December 9, 2024, we also signed a non-binding preliminary memorandum of terms for up to $ 275 million in direct funding for our fab in Manassas, Virginia. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the year ended August 29, 2024 . All period references are to our fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated. Our fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period ending on the Thursday closest to August 31. Fiscal 2025 and 2024 each contain 52 weeks. All tabular dollar amounts are in millions, except per share amounts. Overview We are an industry leader in innovative memory and storage solutions transforming how the world uses information to enrich life for all . With a relentless focus on our customers, technology leadership, manufacturing, and operational excellence, Micron delivers a rich portfolio of high-performance DRAM, NAND, and NOR memory and storage products through our Micron® and Crucial® brands. Every day, the innovations that our people create fuel the data economy, enabling advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and compute-intensive applications that unleash opportunities — from the data center to the intelligent edge and across the client and mobile user experience. We manufacture our products at wholly-owned facilities and also utilize subcontractors for certain manufacturing processes. Our global network of manufacturing centers of excellence not only allows us to benefit from scale while streamlining processes and operations, but it also brings together some of the world’s brightest talent to work on the most advanced memory technology. Centers of excellence bring expertise together in one location, providing an efficient support structure for end-to-end manufacturing, with quicker cycle times, in partnership with teams such as research and development (“R&D”), product development, human resources, procurement, and supply chain. For our locations in Singapore and Taiwan, this is also a combination of bringing fabrication and back-end manufacturing together. We make significant investments to develop proprietary product and process technology, which generally increases bit density per wafer and reduces per-bit manufacturing costs of each generation of product. We continue to introduce new generations of products that offer improved performance characteristics, including higher data transfer rates, advanced packaging solutions, lower power consumption, improved read/write reliability, and increased memory density. We face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets. To remain competitive we must continuously develop and implement new products and technologies and decrease manufacturing costs in spite of inflationary pressures. Our success is largely dependent on obtaining returns on our R&D investments, efficient utilization of our manufacturing infrastructure, development and integration of advanced product and process technologies, market acceptance of our diversified portfolio of semiconductor-based memory and storage solutions, and efficient capital spending. Product Technologies Our product portfolio of memory and storage solutions, advanced solutions, and storage platforms is based on our high-performance semiconductor memory and storage technologies, including DRAM, NAND, and NOR. We sell our products through our business units into various markets in numerous forms, including: components, modules, SSDs, managed NAND, multi-chip packages, and wafers. Many of our system-level solutions combine NAND, a controller, firmware, and in some cases DRAM. DRAM: DRAM products are dynamic random access memory semiconductor devices with low latency that provide high-speed data retrieval with a variety of performance characteristics. DRAM products lose content when power is turned off (“volatile”) and are most commonly used in the data center, client PC, graphics, industrial, and automotive markets. NAND : NAND products are non-volatile, re-writeable semiconductor storage devices that provide high-capacity, low-cost storage with a variety of performance characteristics. NAND is used in SSDs for the data center, client PC, consumer, and automotive markets and in removable storage markets. Managed NAND is used in smartphones and other mobile devices, and in consumer, automotive, and embedded markets. Low-density NAND is ideal for applications like automotive, surveillance, machine-to-machine, automation, printer, and home networking. 29 | 2025 Q2 10-Q Table of Contents NOR : NOR products are non-volatile, re-writable semiconductor memory devices that provide fast read speeds. NOR is most commonly used for reliable code storage (e.g., boot, application, operating system, and execute-in-place code in an embedded system) and for frequently changing small data storage and is ideal for automotive, industrial, and consumer applications. Industry Conditions In the second quarter of 2025, DRAM revenue declined slightly from the prior quarter primarily due to customer actions in consumer-oriented markets to reduce inventories, which was partially offset by continued strength in data center markets, particularly for HBM products. Demand for leading-edge DRAM remains strong, driven by HBM and other data center DRAM. We have shifted our supply to meet the strong demand in data center DRAM resulting in a portfolio mix weighted more towards high-growth and less seasonal segments. In 2024 and the first quarter of 2025, we experienced substantial improvements in revenue, pricing, and margins from 2023 reflecting demand growth, driven in part by deployment of AI, which combined with industry-wide supply discipline, resulted in a substantially improved industry supply and demand balance. In the second quarter of 2025, NAND revenue declined due to lower storage growth by data center customers after several quarters of strong investments and pricing pressure in consumer-oriented markets as customers worked to reduce inventories to align with demand in their end markets. We continue to prudently manage our NAND supply, including the levels of our capital investment, the pace of ramp of our new technology node, and fab utilization consistent with our demand growth. Throughout 2024, we experienced substantial improvements in pricing and margins for NAND from 2023. 30 Table of Contents Results of Operations Consolidated Results Second Quarter First Quarter Second Quarter Six months ended 2025 2025 2024 2025 2024 Revenue $ 8,053 100 % $ 8,709 100 % $ 5,824 100 % $ 16,762 100 % $ 10,550 100 % Cost of goods sold 5,090 63 % 5,361 62 % 4,745 81 % 10,451 62 % 9,506 90 % Gross margin 2,963 37 % 3,348 38 % 1,079 19 % 6,311 38 % 1,044 10 % Research and development 898 11 % 888 10 % 832 14 % 1,786 11 % 1,677 16 % Selling, general, and administrative 285 4 % 288 3 % 280 5 % 573 3 % 543 5 % Other operating (income) expense, net 7 — % (2) — % (224) (4) % 5 — % (239) (2) % Operating income (loss) 1,773 22 % 2,174 25 % 191 3 % 3,947 24 % (937) (9) % Interest income (expense), net (4) — % (11) — % (14) — % (15) — % (14) — % Other non-operating income (expense), net (11) — % (11) — % (7) — % (22) — % (34) — % Income tax (provision) benefit (177) (2) % (283) (3) % 622 11 % (460) (3) % 549 5 % Equity in net income (loss) of equity method investees 2 — % 1 — % 1 — % 3 — % (5) — % Net income (loss) $ 1,583 20 % $ 1,870 21 % $ 793 14 % $ 3,453 21 % $ (441) (4) % Total Revenue: Total revenue for the second quarter of 2025 and first six months of 2025 was impacted by the factors described in the section titled “Industry Conditions” above. Total revenue for the second quarter of 2025 decreased 8% as compared to the first quarter of 2025 primarily due to decreases in sales of both DRAM and NAND products. • Sales of DRAM products decreased 4% primarily due to a high-single-digit percent range decrease in bit shipments, partially offset by a mid-single-digit percent range increase in average selling prices driven by an increased mix of HBM and other data center products. • Sales of NAND products decreased 17% primarily due to a high-teens percent range decrease in average selling prices due to industry conditions and a mix shift to consumer-oriented products, partially offset by modestly higher bit shipments. Total revenue for the second quarter of 2025 increased 38% as compared to the second quarter of 2024 primarily due to increases in sales of both DRAM and NAND products. • Sales of DRAM products increased 47% primarily due to a mid-50% range increase in average selling prices, partially offset by decreases in bit shipments in the mid-single-digit percent range. • Sales of NAND products increased 18% primarily due to a mid-teens percent range increase in bit shipments and a low-single-digit percent range increase in average selling prices. Total revenue for the first six months of 2025 increased 59% as compared to the first six months of 2024 due to increases in both DRAM and NAND sales. • Sales of DRAM products increased 65% primarily due to a mid-60% range increase in average selling prices. • Sales of NAND products increased 46% primarily due to a low-30% range increase in average selling prices and an approximate 10% increase in bit shipments. 31 | 2025 Q2 10-Q Table of Contents Consolidated Gross Margin : Our consolidated gross margin has been impacted by the factors described in the section titled “Industry Conditions” above. Our consolidated gross margin percentage decreased to 37% for the second quarter of 2025 from 38% for the first quarter of 2025, primarily due to a decrease in margins for NAND products, partially offset by an improvement in margins for DRAM products. NAND margins declined primarily due to decreases in average selling prices and a mix shift to consumer-oriented products. DRAM margins improved primarily due to an increased mix of HBM and other data center products. Our consolidated gross margin percentage improved to 37% for the second quarter of 2025 from 19% for the second quarter of 2024 and improved to 38% for the first six months of 2025 from 10% for the first six months of 2024. Improvements in our consolidated gross margins for the second quarter and first six months of 2025 as compared to corresponding periods of 2024, were primarily due to increases in average selling prices for both DRAM and NAND, manufacturing cost reductions for NAND, and an increased mix in sales to high-margin cloud products, particularly HBM. Our consolidated gross margin for the second quarter and first six months of 2024 reflected $382 million and $987 million, respectively, of benefit due to lower costs from the sale of inventories written down to their net realizable value in 2023.

Changes in revenue for each business unit for the second quarter of 2025 as compared to the first quarter of 2025 were as follows: • CNBU revenue increased 4% primarily due to higher sales of HBM products, which increased more than 50%. • SBU revenue decreased 20% primarily due to lower storage investments by data center customers after several quarters of very strong growth, and overall NAND industry pricing declines. • MBU revenue decreased 30% primarily due to decreases in bit shipments, as mobile customers managed inventories lower, and declines in average selling prices for both mobile DRAM and NAND. • EBU revenue decreased 3% primarily due to decreases in automotive sales as customers managed inventories lower. Changes in revenue for each business unit for the second quarter and the first six months of 2025 as compared to the corresponding periods of 2024 were as follows: • CNBU revenue increased 109% and 128%, respectively, primarily due to increases in average selling prices and bit shipments driven by improved demand, particularly in cloud server markets, including HBM. • SBU revenue increased 54% and 100%, respectively, primarily due to increases in bit shipments and average selling prices for NAND. • MBU revenue decreased 33% and 10%, respectively, primarily due to decreases in bit shipments partially offset by increases in DRAM average selling prices. • EBU revenue decreased 8% and 3%, respectively, primarily due to decreases in DRAM bit shipments and declines in average selling prices for NAND, partially offset by increases in NAND bit shipments. 32 Table of Contents Operating Income (Loss) by Business Unit Second Quarter First Quarter Second Quarter Six months ended 2025 2024 2024 2025 2024 CNBU $ 1,919 42 % $ 1,711 39 % $ 28 1 % $ 3,630 41 % $ (369) (9) % SBU 24 2 % 347 20 % (217) (24) % 371 12 % (707) (45) % MBU 60 6 % 327 21 % (9) (1) % 387 15 % (696) (24) % EBU 3 — % 11 1 % (1) — % 14 1 % 9 — % All Other 1 25 % (2) (50) % 21 84 % (1) (13) % 25 81 % $ 2,007 $ 2,394 $ (178) $ 4,401 $ (1,738) Percentages reflect operating income (loss) as a percentage of revenue for each business unit. Changes in operating income or loss for each business unit for the second quarter of 2025 as compared to the first quarter of 2025 were as follows: • CNBU operating income increased primarily due to increases in high-value HBM products. • SBU operating income decreased primarily due to declines in average selling prices. • MBU operating income decreased primarily due to lower bit shipments and declines in average selling prices. • EBU operating income decreased primarily due to declines in average selling prices and lower DRAM bit shipments, partially offset by higher NAND bit shipments and manufacturing cost reductions. Changes in operating income or loss for each business unit for the second quarter and the first six months of 2025 as compared to the corresponding periods of 2024 were as follows: • CNBU operating income (loss) improved primarily due to increases in average selling prices and high-value HBM products. • SBU operating income (loss) improved primarily due to increases in average selling prices and manufacturing cost reductions. • MBU operating income (loss) improved primarily due to increases in DRAM average selling prices and manufacturing cost reductions. • EBU operating income (loss) was relatively unchanged. Operating Expenses and Other Research and Development: R&D expenses vary primarily with the number of development and pre-qualification wafers processed, the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development, and personnel costs. Because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products, we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing. Development of a product is deemed complete when it is qualified through internal reviews and tests for performance and reliability. R&D expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification. R&D expenses for the second quarter of 2025 were relatively unchanged as compared to the first quarter of 2025. R&D expenses for the second quarter and first six months of 2025 increased 8% and 6%, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods of 2024 primarily due to an increase in employee compensation and subcontractor expense, partially offset by lower volumes of development and prequalification wafers. Selling, General, and Administrative: SG&A expenses for the second quarter of 2025 were relatively unchanged as compared to the first quarter of 2025. SG&A expenses for the second quarter and first six months of 2025 increased 2% and 6%, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods of 2024 primarily due to an increase in employee compensation.

Applying this updated rate to our year-to-date earnings resulted in the tax benefit of $622 million recognized in the second quarter of 2024. The change in our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2025 as compared to the second quarter of 2024 was primarily due to changes in profitability and the aforementioned calculation of our tax expense in the second quarter of 2024. The change in our effective tax rate for the first six months of 2025 as compared to the first six months of 2024 was primarily due to changes in profitability. The change in our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2025 as compared to the first quarter of 2025 was primarily due discrete items related to tax return filings. We operate in a number of jurisdictions outside the United States, including Singapore, where we have tax incentive arrangements. These incentives expire, in whole or in part, at various dates through 2034 and are conditional, in part, upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds. The effect of tax incentive arrangements reduced our tax provision by $171 million (benefiting our diluted earnings per share by $0.15) for the second quarter of 2025, $212 million (benefiting our diluted earnings per share by $0.19) for the first quarter of 2025, and $383 million (benefiting our diluted earnings per share by $0.34) for the first six months of 2025, respectively. As a result of the low level of profitability and geographic mix of income, the benefit from tax incentive arrangements was not material for the periods presented for 2024. Further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project, including Pillar Two Model Rules (“Pillar Two”), undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”). Nearly all European Union member states have enacted the Pillar Two legislation, which will be effective for us in 2025. We do not expect these enacted laws to materially impact our effective tax rate for 2025. On November 27, 2024, Singapore enacted legislation to implement Pillar Two, which will apply to us starting in 2026. While we are still evaluating the impacts, we expect our effective tax rate for 2026 to be in the high-teens percentage range. We also continue to monitor for additional guidance and legislative changes to Pillar Two in the jurisdictions where we operate. Various tax reforms are being considered in multiple jurisdictions that, if enacted, contain provisions that could materially impact our tax expense. We continue to monitor the potential impact of these various tax reform proposals to our overall global effective tax rate and financial statements. Other: Further information related to our operating expenses and other can be found in “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Equity Compensation Plans”: Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and financing obtained from capital markets and financial institutions. Cash generated from operations is highly dependent on selling prices for our products, which can vary significantly from period to period. Cash and marketable investments totaled $9.59 billion as of February 27, 2025, and $9.15 billion as of August 29, 2024. Our cash and investments consist primarily of bank deposits, money market funds, and liquid investment-grade, fixed-income securities, which are diversified among industries and individual issuers. To mitigate credit risk, we invest through high-credit-quality financial institutions and by policy generally limit the concentration of credit exposure by restricting the amount of investments with any single obligor. As of February 27, 2025, $2.12 billion of our cash and marketable investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries. 34 Table of Contents We continuously evaluate alternatives for efficiently funding our capital expenditures and ongoing operations. We expect to engage in a variety of financing transactions, from time to time, for such purposes as well as to refinance our existing indebtedness, including the issuance of securities. As of February 27, 2025, $2.50 billion was available to draw under our existing credit facility. On March 12, 2025, we terminated our existing undrawn credit facility and entered into a new five-year unsecured Revolving Credit Facility and increased our borrowing capacity. Under the Revolving Credit Facility, we can draw up to $3.50 billion. Funding of certain significant capital projects is also dependent on the receipt of government incentives, which are subject to conditions and may not be obtained. To develop new product and process technology, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality, we must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies, facilities and equipment, and R&D. We estimate capital expenditures in 2025 for property, plant, and equipment, net of proceeds from government incentives, to be approximately $14 billion. Actual amounts for 2025 will vary depending on market conditions and may vary from quarter to quarter due to the timing of expenditures and proceeds from government incentives. As of February 27, 2025, we had purchase obligations of approximately $1.73 billion for the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment, substantially all of which is expected to be paid within one year. For a description of other contractual obligations, such as leases and debt, see “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Leases,” and “ – Debt.” To support projected memory demand in the second half of the decade, we will need to add new DRAM wafer capacity. Following the enactment of the CHIPS Act, we announced plans to invest in two leading-edge memory manufacturing fab facilities in the United States, based on CHIPS Act support through grants and investment tax credits. As part of this plan, in September 2022, we broke ground on a leading-edge memory manufacturing fab in Boise, Idaho. Construction of the fab began in October 2023, with meaningful DRAM output projected in 2027. In addition, in October 2022, we announced plans to build a second leading-edge DRAM manufacturing facility, consisting of up to four fabs to be built over the next 20-plus years, in Clay, New York. We expect construction site preparation to begin in calendar 2025, with production anticipated to ramp in the latter half of the decade. We expect these new fabs to be key to meeting our requirements for additional wafer capacity starting in the second half of the decade and beyond, in line with industry demand trends and our objective of maintaining stable bit share. On December 9, 2024, we entered into direct funding agreements with the U.S. Department of Commerce for up to $6.1 billion in direct funding pursuant to the CHIPS Act for a planned fab in Boise, Idaho and two planned fabs in Clay, New York. On December 9, 2024, we also signed a non-binding preliminary memorandum of terms for up to $275 million in direct funding for our fab in Manassas, Virginia. See “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – CHIPS Act Funding Agreements.” We elected not to pursue the federal loans previously disclosed as included in the non-binding preliminary memorandum of terms for the Boise, Idaho and Clay, New York fabs. In addition, we receive a 25% investment tax credit on qualified investments in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing under the CHIPS Act. We have also signed a non-binding term sheet with the State of New York that provides up to $5.5 billion in funding for the planned four-fab facility over the next 20-plus years through a combination of tax credits for qualified capital investments and incentives for eligible new job wages. Additionally, we began enablement of cleanroom space within our existing manufacturing fab in Hiroshima, Japan, that will support production of advanced DRAM using EUV lithography. We are expanding our production capacity in Taiwan for DRAM and HBM products to meet rising market demand. We also continue to advance our global back-end assembly and test network in order to support our product portfolio and extend our ability to deliver on global customer demand in the future. Construction is progressing on the expansion of our existing assembly and test facility in Xi’an, China, to provide space to add more product capability, to allow us over time to serve more of the demand from our customers in China. Construction is also progressing for the assembly and test facility in Gujarat, India to address demand in the latter half of this decade. In January 2025, we broke ground on an HBM advanced packaging facility in Singapore to meaningfully expand our total advanced packaging capacity beginning in calendar 2027. Our Board of Directors has authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to $10 billion of our outstanding common stock through open-market purchases, block trades, privately-negotiated transactions, derivative transactions, and/or pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date, does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, and is subject to market conditions, restrictions applicable under our CHIPS Act direct funding agreements, and our ongoing determination of the best use of available cash. Through February 27, 35 | 2025 Q2 10-Q Table of Contents 2025, we had repurchased an aggregate of $7.19 billion of the authorized amount. See “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Equity” and “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – CHIPS Act Funding Agreements.” On March 20, 2025, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.115 per share, payable in cash on April 15, 2025, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 31, 2025. The declaration and payment of any future cash dividends are at the discretion and subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors' decisions regarding the amount and payment of dividends will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions, debt service obligations, contractual restrictions, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. We expect that our cash and investments, cash flows from operations, expected funding from government incentives, and available financing will be sufficient to meet our requirements at least through the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Cash Flows Six months ended February 27, 2025 February 29, 2024 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 7,186 $ 2,620 Net cash provided by (used for) investing activities (6,300) (2,709) Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities (326) (458) Effect of changes in currency exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash (49) (8) Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 511 $ (555) Operating Activities: Cash provided by operating activities reflects net income (loss) adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation expense, amortization of intangible assets, and stock-based compensation, and the effects of changes in operating assets and liabilities . Th e increase in cash provided by operating activities for the first six months of 2025 as compared to the first six months of 2024 was primarily due to net income in the current year adjusted for non-cash items and the effect of a decrease in receivables, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a decrease in other current liabilities. Investing Activities: For the first six months of 2025, net cash used for investing activi ties consisted primarily of $7.26 billion of expenditures for property, plant, and equipment; partially offset by $1.03 billion received from government incentives to offset capital expenditures and $58 million of net inflows from maturities, sales, and purchases of available-for-sale securities. For the first six months of 2024, net cash used for investing activities consisted primarily of $3.18 billion of expenditures for property, plant, and equipment; partially offset by $234 million received from government incentives to offset capital expenditures and $261 million of net inflows from maturities, sales, and purchases of available-for-sale securities. Financing Activities: For the first six months of 2025, net cash used for financing activi ties consisted primarily of $2.63 billion of repayments of debt, which included the prepayment of the 2026 Notes, 2026 Term Loan A, and 2027 Term Loan A borrowings; and $261 million for paym ents of dividends to shareholders; partially offset by $1.68 billion of proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Term Loan A and approximately $1.00 billion of proceeds from the issuance of the 2035 Notes. See “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Debt.” For the first six months of 2024, net cash used for financing activities consisted primarily of $1.10 billion of repayments of debt, which included the prepayment of the 2024 Term Loan A and a portion of the 2025 Term Loan A borrowings; $256 million for payments of dividends to shareholders; and $82 million of payments on equipment purchase contracts; partially offset by approximately $1.00 billion of proceeds from the issuance of the 2031 Notes. 36 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Estimates For a discussion of our critical accounting estimates, see “Part II – Item 7.

During the second quarter of 2025, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS For a discussion of legal proceedings, see “Part I. Financial Information – Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Contingencies” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. SEC regulations require disclosure of certain proceedings related to environmental matters unless we reasonably believe that the related monetary sanctions, if any, will be less than a specified threshold. We use a threshold of $1 million for this purpose. 37 | 2025 Q2 10-Q Table of Contents ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, this section discusses important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by us. The order of presentation is not necessarily indicative of the level of risk that each factor poses to us. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or stock price. Our operations could also be affected by other factors that are presently unknown to us or not considered significant. Risk Factor Summary Risks Related to Our Business, Operations, and Industry • volatility in average selling prices of our products; • a range of factors that may adversely affect our gross margins; • our international operations, including geopolitical risks; • the highly competitive nature of our industry; • our ability to develop and produce new and competitive memory and storage technologies and products; • realizing expected returns from capacity expansions; • achieving or maintaining certain outcomes and the compliance requirements associated with incentives from various governments; • availability and quality of materials, supplies, electrical power, gas, water, and capital equipment, or dependency on third-party service providers; • a downturn or ongoing adverse conditions in regional or worldwide economies; • disruptions to our manufacturing process from operational issues, natural disasters, or other events; • dependency on certain customers, including international customers, and end markets; • products that fail to meet specifications, are defective, or are incompatible with end uses; • breaches of our security systems or products, systems failures, interruptions, delays in service, catastrophic events, and resulting interruptions of our systems or those of our customers, suppliers, or business partners; • uncertainties and outcomes associated with the use and evolution of AI; • attracting, retaining, and motivating highly skilled employees; • responsible sourcing requirements and related regulations; • sustainability and governance expectations or standards; • acquisitions and/or alliances; and • restructure plans may not realize expected savings or other benefits. Risks Related to Intellectual Property and Litigation • protecting our intellectual property and retaining key employees who are knowledgeable of and develop our intellectual property; • legal, regulatory and administrative investigations, inquiries, proceedings, and claims; and • claims that our products or manufacturing processes infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others or failure to obtain or renew license agreements covering such intellectual property. Risks Related to Laws and Regulations • impacts of government actions and compliance with tariffs, trade restrictions, and/or trade regulations; • tax expense and tax laws in key jurisdictions; and • compliance with laws, regulations, or industry standards, including environmental considerations. Risks Related to Capitalization and Financial Markets • our ability to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing; • our debt obligations; • changes in foreign currency exchange rates; • counterparty default risk; • volatility in the trading price of our common stock; and • fluctuations in the amount and frequency of our common stock repurchases and payment of cash dividends and resulting impacts. 38 Table of Contents Risks Related to Our Business, Operations, and Industry Volatility in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory and storage products may adversely affect our business. We have experienced significant volatility in our average selling prices and may continue to experience such volatility in the future. In the past five years, annual percentage changes in DRAM average selling prices have ranged from plus low-teen percentage range to a minus high-40% range. In the past five years, annual percentage changes in NAND average selling prices have ranged from plus low-30% to a minus low-50% range. In some prior periods, average selling prices for our products have been below our manufacturing costs and we may experience such circumstances in the future. Average selling prices for our products that decline faster than our costs have recently had an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and in future periods could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Our gross margins may be adversely affected by a range of factors. In addition to the impact of our average selling prices, our gross margins are dependent, in part, upon continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes and product designs. Factors that may limit our ability to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to prevent deterioration of or improve gross margins include, but are not limited to: • strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix; • increasing complexity of our product portfolio, which may impact operational costs; • increasing complexity of manufacturing processes; • difficulties in transitioning to smaller line-width process technologies or additional 3D memory layers or NAND cell levels; • process complexity including number of mask layers and fabrication steps; • manufacturing yield and defect density; • technological barriers; • changes in process technologies; • new products that may require relatively larger die sizes or advanced packaging technologies; • start-up or other costs associated with capacity expansions; • higher costs of goods and services due to inflationary pressures, regulatory actions, including tariffs or trade restrictions, or market conditions; and • higher manufacturing costs per gigabit due to fabrication facility underutilization, lower wafer output, and insufficient volume to run new technology nodes to achieve cost optimization. Many factors may result in a reduction of our output or a delay in ramping production, which have in the past and could in the future lead to underutilization of our production assets. These factors may include, among others, a weak demand environment, industry oversupply, inventory surpluses, difficulties in ramping emerging technologies, supply chain disruptions, and delays from equipment suppliers. A significant portion of our manufacturing costs are fixed and do not vary proportionally with changes in production output. As a result, lower utilization, lower wafer output, and corresponding increases in our per gigabit manufacturing costs could result in higher inventory carrying costs, and have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our gross margins, business, results of operations, or financial condition. We have a broad portfolio of products to address our customers’ needs, which span multiple market segments and are subject to rapid technological changes. Our manufacturing costs on a per gigabit basis vary across our portfolio as they are largely influenced by the technology node in which the solution was developed. We strive to balance our demand and supply for each technology node, but the dynamics of our markets and our customers can create periods of imbalance, which can lead us to carry elevated inventory levels and underutilized capacity. Consequently, we may incur charges in connection with obsolete or excess inventories, or we may not fully recover our costs, which would reduce our gross margins. For example, in 2023, we recorded aggregate charges of $1.83 billion to write down the carrying value of our inventories to their estimated net realizable value. In addition, due to the customized nature of certain products we manufacture, we may be unable to sell certain finished goods inventories to alternative customers or manufacture in-process inventory to different specifications, which may result in excess and obsolescence charges in future periods. 39 | 2025 Q2 10-Q Table of Contents In addition, if we are unable to supply products that meet customer design and performance specifications, we may be required to sell such products at lower average selling prices, which may reduce our gross margins. Our gross margins may also be impacted by shifts in product mix, driven by our strategy to optimize our portfolio to best respond to changing market dynamics. We may not be able to predict or quickly respond to trends in the dynamics of our markets and our customers or changes in customer demand, which could negatively impact our gross margin. Our inability to prevent deterioration of or improve gross margins could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. We face geopolitical and other risks associated with our international operations that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. In addition to our U.S. operations, a substantial portion of our operations are conducted in Taiwan, Singapore, Japan, Malaysia, China, and India, and many of our customers, suppliers, and vendors also operate internationally. In 2024, nearly half of our revenue was from sales to customers who have headquarters located outside the United States, while over 80% of our revenue in 2024 was from products shipped to customer locations outside the United States. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks, including: • restrictions on sales of goods or services to one or more of our significant foreign customers; • export and import duties, changes to import and export regulations, customs regulations and processes, and restrictions on the transfer of funds, including currency controls in China and global tariffs, which could negatively affect the amount and timing of payments from certain of our customers and, as a result, our cash flows; • compliance with U.S. and international laws involving international operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, sanctions and anti-corruption laws, export and import laws, and similar rules and regulations; • theft of intellectual property; • political and economic instability, including instability resulting from domestic and international conflicts; • government actions or civil unrest preventing the flow of products and materials, including delays in shipping and obtaining products and materials, cancellation of orders, or loss or damage of products; • problems with the transportation or delivery of products and materials; • issues arising from cultural or language differences and labor unrest; • longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; • compliance with trade, technical standards, and other laws in a variety of jurisdictions; • contractual and regulatory limitations on the ability to maintain flexibility with staffing levels; • disruptions to manufacturing or R&D activities as a result of actions imposed by governments; • changes in economic policies of foreign governments; • loss of market share in foreign jurisdictions resulting from political and regulatory uncertainty regarding possible trade restrictions or other government actions; • difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and • public health issues. If we or our customers, suppliers, or vendors are impacted by any of these risks, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Following the May 2023 decision of its cybersecurity review of our products sold in China, the CAC determined that critical information infrastructure operators in China may not purchase Micron products, impacting our revenue with companies headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong, including direct sales as well as indirect sales through distributors. Further actions by the Chinese government, through CAC action or other means, could impact revenue inside or outside China, or our operations in China, or our ability to ship products to our customers, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 40 Table of Contents In addition, the U.S. government has in the past and continues to restrict American firms, including us, from selling products and software to certain of our customers and may in the future impose similar restrictions on one or more of our significant customers. These restrictions may not prohibit our competitors from selling similar products to our customers, which may result in our loss of sales and market share. Even as such restrictions are lifted, financial or other penalties or continuing export restrictions imposed with respect to our customers could have a continuing negative impact on our future revenue and results of operations, and we may not be able to recover any customers or market share we lose, or make such recoveries at acceptable average selling prices, while complying with such restrictions. Political, economic, or other actions may adversely affect our operations in Taiwan. A majority of our DRAM production output in 2024 was from our fabrication facilities in Taiwan, and any loss of output could have a material adverse effect on us. Any political, economic, or other actions may also adversely affect our customers and the technology industry supply chain, for which Taiwan is a central hub, and as a result, could have a material adverse impact on us. The semiconductor memory and storage markets are highly competitive. We face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets from a number of companies, including Kioxia Holdings Corporation; Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.; SK hynix Inc.; Sandisk Corporation; Yangtze Memory Technologies Co., Ltd. (“YMTC”); and ChangXin Memory Technologies, Inc. (“CXMT”). Our competitors may use aggressive pricing to obtain market share. Some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have a larger market share and greater resources to invest in technology, capitalize on growth opportunities, and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete. Consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage as our competitors may benefit from increased manufacturing scale and a stronger product portfolio. Alternatively, new entrants into memory and storage market could have a significant adverse impact on our competitive position. We operate in different jurisdictions than our competitors and may be impacted by unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. In addition, some governments may provide, or have provided and may continue to provide, significant assistance, financial or otherwise, to some of our competitors or to new entrants and may intervene in support of national industries and/or competitors. As a result, we face the threat of increasing competition and oversupply due to significant investment in the semiconductor industry by the Chinese government and various state-owned or affiliated entities, such as YMTC and CXMT. In addition, the CAC’s decision that critical information infrastructure operators in China may not purchase Micron products had an adverse impact on our ability to compete effectively in China and elsewhere. We and our competitors generally seek to increase supply to address growing market demands, improve yields, and reduce die size, which could result in significant increases in worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices. Increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage also result from fabrication capacity expansions, either by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization, or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory and storage production. Our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply. We, and some of our competitors, have plans to ramp, or are constructing or ramping, production at new fabrication facilities. Increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage, if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand, could lead to declines in average selling prices for our products and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Additionally, rapid technological change in markets we serve could contribute to shortened product life cycles and a decline in average selling prices of our products. If competitors are more successful at developing or implementing new product or process technology, their products could have cost or performance advantages. The competitive nature of our industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 41 | 2025 Q2 10-Q Table of Contents Our future success depends on our ability to develop and produce new and competitive memory and storage technologies and products. Our key semiconductor memory and storage technologies face technological barriers to continue to meet long-term customer needs. These barriers include achieving acceptable yields and quality for HBM products with their multiple chip layers, potential limitations on stacking additional 3D memory layers, increasing bits per cell (i.e., cell levels), meeting higher density requirements, developing advanced packaging solutions, improving power consumption and reliability, and delivering advanced features and higher performance. We may face technological barriers to continue to shrink our products at our current or historical rate, which has generally reduced per gigabit cost. We have invested and expect to continue to invest in R&D for new and existing products and process technologies, such as EUV lithography, to continue to deliver advanced product requirements. Such new technologies can add complexity and risk to our schedule and may affect our costs and production output. We may be unable to recover our investment in R&D or otherwise realize the economic benefits of reducing die size or increasing memory and storage densities. Our competitors are working to develop new memory and storage technologies that may offer performance and/or cost advantages to existing technologies and render existing technologies obsolete. Accordingly, our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce viable and competitive new memory and storage technologies. We are developing new products, including system-level memory and storage products and solutions, which complement our traditional products or leverage their underlying design or process technology. We have invested and expect to continue to invest in new semiconductor product and system-level solution development. We are increasingly differentiating our products and solutions to meet the specific demands of our customers, which increases our reliance on our customers’ ability to accurately forecast the needs and preferences of their customers. Recent technologies, such as generative AI models have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for HBM and other advanced products in the data center and other markets, the long-term trajectory is unknown and associated demand may fluctuate. If we or our competitors increase HBM supply at a rate that outpaces HBM demand, conversion of HBM capacity to supply other DRAM products could result in significant supply-demand imbalances. Due to the higher performance and more complex manufacturing process, HBM requires a higher number of wafers to produce the same number of bits as conventional DRAM in the same technology node. This could lead to declines in average selling prices for our DRAM products and could materially affect our business. Our product demand forecasts may also be impacted significantly by the strategic actions of our customers. In addition, our ability to successfully introduce new products often requires us to make product specification decisions multiple years in advance of when new products enter the market. It is important that we deliver products in a timely manner with increasingly advanced performance characteristics at the time our customers are designing and evaluating samples for their products. If we do not meet their product design schedules, our customers may exclude us from further consideration as a supplier for those products. The process to develop new products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality, performance, and reliability, often well in advance of a planned ramp of production, in order to secure design wins with our customers. Many factors may negatively impact our ability to meet anticipated timelines and/or expected or required quality standards with respect to the development of certain of our products. In addition, some of our components have long lead-times, requiring us to place orders up to a year in advance of anticipated demand. Such long lead-times increase the risk of excess inventory or loss of sales in the event our forecasts vary substantially from actual demand. There can be no assurance of the following: • we will be successful in developing competitive new semiconductor memory and storage technologies and products; • we will be able to cost-effectively manufacture new products; • we will be able to successfully achieve revenue targets for these technologies; • margins and cash flows generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts; • we will be able to establish or maintain key relationships with customers, or that we will not be prohibited from working with certain customers, for specific chip set or design requirements; • we will accurately predict and design products that meet our customers' specifications; or • we will be able to introduce new products into the market and qualify them with our customers on a timely basis. 42 Table of Contents Unsuccessful efforts to develop new memory and storage technologies and products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. We may not be able to achieve expected returns from capacity expansions. We have commenced expansion of our production capacity in the United States and in other regions where we operate. Semiconductor fabs are complex, capital-intensive projects and require specialized knowledge, expertise, experience, and skill sets to construct and operate. Our construction projects are highly dependent on available sources of materials, and specialized equipment, as well as labor, skilled sub-contractors and other service providers. Increasing demand, supply constraints, inflation, tariffs, trade restrictions, and other market conditions could result in shortages and higher costs. Additionally, difficulties in obtaining labor, skilled sub-contractors and other service providers or other resources could result in delays in completion of our construction projects and cost increases, including costs to operate these facilities. In the United States and in certain other regions, fab building has been uncommon in recent years. Concurrent semiconductor expansion projects across the industry introduce significant competition for the limited pool of construction talent with requisite expertise and experience in these regions. As such, expanding production capacity in the United States and certain other regions may introduce more challenges than we would experience in geographies with more established ecosystems. In addition, these expansions involve several risks including the following: • inability to meet capital expenditure requirements for capacity expansions, including during periods of relatively low free cash flow generation, resulting from challenging memory and storage industry conditions; • unavailability of necessary funding, which may include external sources; • inability to realize expected grants, investment tax credits, and other government incentives, including through the CHIPS Act and other national, international, state, and local grants; • potential changes in laws or provisions of grants, investment tax credits, and other government incentives, including the CHIPS Act; • delays and potential restrictions related to environmental and other government regulations or permits; • potential restrictions on expanding in certain geographies; • inability to complete construction as scheduled and within budget; • inability to attract, retain and motivate key talent; • inability to timely ramp production in a cost-effective manner; • increases to our cost structure until new production is ramped to adequate scale; and • insufficient customer demand to utilize our increased capacity. From time to time, we have experienced impacts from certain of the above items and, because these risks are a characteristic of our business, we expect to experience them in the future. Depending on the nature and extent of the impact from these risks, we may be unable to produce sufficient capacity in the expected time frame which could result in delays in the completion of our construction projects and increased costs, including costs to operate these facilities. We invest our capital in areas that we believe best align with our business strategy and optimize future returns. Investments in capital expenditures may not generate expected returns or cash flows. Significant judgment is required to determine which capital investments will result in optimal returns, and we could invest in projects that are ultimately less profitable than those projects we do not select. Delays in completion and ramping of new production facilities, or failure to optimize our investment choices, could significantly impact our ability to realize expected returns on our capital expenditures. Any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 43 | 2025 Q2 10-Q Table of Contents Our incentives from various governments are conditioned upon achieving or maintaining certain outcomes and satisfying compliance requirements and are subject to reduction, termination, or clawback, and could impose certain limitations on our business. We have received, and may in the future continue to receive, benefits and incentives from national, state, and local governments in various regions of the world designed to encourage us to establish, maintain, or increase investment, workforce, research and development, or production in those regions. However, there is no guarantee that such government incentives and benefits will continue to be available in the future on the same terms, terms that are acceptable to us or at all. In addition, we have discretion in the timing of use of certain of these incentives. If we choose to exercise such discretion due to the cyclicality of our business or other factors, we may not be able to fully utilize these incentives. Our future business plans may be impacted by obtaining these government incentives, which may take various forms, including grants, subsidies, loans, and tax arrangements, and typically require us to achieve or maintain certain levels of investment, capital spending, employment, technology deployment or development milestones, construction or production milestones, or research and development activities to qualify for such incentives or could restrict us from undertaking certain activities. Failure to achieve such milestones could result in up to all of certain incentives being clawed back. In some cases, these incentives have additional terms and conditions regarding our business operations or governance that are required to be satisfied as a condition to receive incentives or disbursements. Compliance with these terms and conditions may add complexity to our operations and increase our costs and failure to comply could result in termination of incentive programs or clawbacks of incentive amounts received. We may be unable to obtain sufficient future incentives to continue to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and operating costs, without which our cost structure may be adversely impacted and planned capital expenditures and research and development expenditures may be affected. For example, in December 2024, we entered into direct funding agreements, providing funds for the construction of fab facilities in Idaho and New York, with the United States Department of Commerce (the “Department”) under the Department’s CHIPS Incentives Program established pursuant to the CHIPS Act. The awards under the direct funding agreements are subject to various conditions and we may not receive the funding expected on the same terms or at all. We cannot guarantee that we will successfully achieve or maintain outcomes or satisfy the compliance requirements to qualify for these incentives or that the granting agencies will provide or continue to provide such funding. See “Part I. Financial Information –Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – CHIPS Act Funding Agreements.” These incentive arrangements, including the funding agreements, typically provide the granting agencies with rights to audit our compliance with their terms and obligations. Such audits could result in modifications to, or termination of, the applicable incentive program. In addition, the incentives we receive, including the funding agreements, are in some cases subject to reduction, termination, or clawback under certain circumstances, and any decrease or clawback of government incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be adversely affected by the availability and quality of materials, supplies, electrical power, gas, water, and capital equipment, or dependency on third-party service providers. Our supply chain and operations are dependent on the availability of materials that meet exacting standards and the use of third parties to provide us with components and services. We generally have multiple sources of supply for our materials and services. However, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain materials, components, and services that meet our standards and, in some cases, materials, components, or services are provided by a single or sole source, and we may be unable to qualify new suppliers on a timely basis. The availability of materials or components such as chemicals, silicon wafers, gases, photoresist, semiconductors, substrates, lead frames, printed circuit boards, targets, and reticle glass blanks is impacted by various factors. These factors could include a shortage of raw materials or a disruption in the processing or purification of those raw materials into finished goods. Shortages or increases in lead times have occurred in the past, are currently occurring with respect to some materials and components, and may occur from time to time in the future because of the nature of the industry. Constraints within our supply chain for certain materials and integrated circuit components could limit our bit shipments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 44 Table of Contents Our manufacturing processes are also dependent on our relationships with third-party manufacturers of controllers, analog integrated circuits, and other components used in some of our products and with outsourced semiconductor foundries, assembly and test providers, contract manufacturers, logistics carriers, and other service providers, including providers of maintenance for our advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment and providers of electricity and other utilities. Although we have certain long-term contracts with some of our suppliers, many of these contracts do not provide for long-term capacity or pricing commitments. To the extent we do not have firm commitments from our third-party suppliers over a specific time period or for any specific capacity, quantity, and/or pricing, our suppliers may allocate capacity to their other customers and capacity and/or materials may not be available when needed or at reasonable prices. Inflationary pressures may continue to increase costs for materials, supplies, and services. Regardless of contract structure, large swings in demand may exceed our contracted supply and/or our suppliers’ capacity to meet those demand changes resulting in a shortage of parts, materials, or capacity needed to manufacture our products. In addition, if any of our suppliers were to cease operations or become insolvent, this could impact their ability to provide us with necessary supplies, and we may not be able to obtain the needed supply in a timely way or at all from other providers. Certain materials are primarily available in a limited number of countries, including rare earth elements, minerals, and metals. Trade disputes, geopolitical tensions, economic circumstances, political conditions, or public health issues may limit our ability to obtain such materials. Although these rare earth and other materials are generally available from multiple suppliers, China is a predominant producer of these materials. China has in the past restricted export of certain of these materials and may in the future continue to restrict or stop exporting these materials, and as a result, our suppliers’ ability to obtain such supply may be constrained, and we may be unable to obtain sufficient quantities, or obtain supply in a timely manner, or at a commercially reasonable cost. Constrained supply of rare earth elements, minerals, and metals may restrict our ability to manufacture certain of our products and make it difficult or impossible to compete with other semiconductor memory and storage manufacturers who are able to obtain sufficient quantities of these materials from China. We and/or our suppliers and service providers could be affected by regional conflicts, civil unrest, labor disruptions, sanctions, tariffs, embargoes, or other trade restrictions, and retaliatory actions in response to such actions, as well as laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change, conflict minerals, responsible sourcing practices, public health crises, or other matters, which could limit the supply of our materials and/or increase the cost. Environmental regulations could limit our ability to procure or use certain chemicals or materials in our operations or products. In addition, disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of materials. Our ability to procure components to repair equipment essential for our manufacturing processes could also be negatively impacted by various restrictions or disruptions in supply chains, among other items. The disruption of our supply of materials, components, or services, or the extension of our lead times could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Our operations are dependent on a reliable and uninterrupted supply of electrical power, gas, and water to our manufacturing facilities. Any power shortages, capacity constraints, prolonged outages, or significant or unexpected increases in the cost of power could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Our operations are dependent on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment that enables the transition to lower cost manufacturing processes. For certain key types of equipment, including photolithography tools, we are sometimes dependent on a single supplier. From time to time, we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to suppliers’ limited capacity. Our inability to obtain equipment on a timely basis could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing processes and reduce our costs. Delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production and could increase our overall costs of a ramp. Our inability to obtain advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Our construction projects to expand production and R&D capacity are highly dependent on available sources of labor, materials, equipment, and services. Increasing demand, supply constraints, inflation, and other market conditions could result in increasing shortages and higher costs for these items. Difficulties in obtaining these resources could result in delays in completion of our construction projects and cost increases, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 45 | 2025 Q2 10-Q Table of Contents Our inability to source materials, supplies, capital equipment, or third-party services could affect our overall production output and our ability to fulfill customer demand. Significant or prolonged shortages of our products could halt customer manufacturing and damage our relationships with these customers. Any damage to our customer relationships as a result of a shortage of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Similarly, if our customers experience disruptions to their supplies, materials, components, or services, or the extension of their lead times, they may reduce, cancel, or alter the timing of their purchases with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Downturns or ongoing adverse conditions in regional or worldwide economies may harm our business. Downturns or ongoing adverse conditions in regional or worldwide economies, due to inflation, geopolitics, major central bank policy actions including interest rate increases, public health crises, or other factors, have harmed our business in the past and current and future downturns could also adversely affect our business. Adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that incorporate our products, such as personal computers, smartphones, automobiles, and servers. Reduced demand for memory and storage products could result in significant decreases in our average selling prices and product sales. In addition, to the extent our customers or distributors have elevated inventory levels or are impacted by a deterioration in credit markets, we may experience a decrease in short-term and/or long-term demand resulting in industry oversupply and declines in pricing for our products. A deterioration of conditions in regional or worldwide credit markets could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures. In addition, we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties. Difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivable due to credit defaults. Additionally, our current or potential future customers may experience cash flow problems and as a result may modify, delay, or cancel plans to purchase our products. Any inability of our current or potential future customers to pay us for our products may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow. As a result, downturns or ongoing adverse conditions in regional or worldwide economies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. If our manufacturing process is disrupted by operational issues, natural disasters, or other events, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. We and our subcontractors manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance. Difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs. We and our subcontractors maintain operations and continuously implement new product and process technology at manufacturing facilities, which are widely dispersed in multiple locations in several countries including the United States, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, Malaysia, China, and India. As a result of the necessary interdependence within our network of manufacturing facilities, an operational disruption at one of our or a subcontractor’s facilities may have a disproportionate impact on our ability to produce many of our products. From time to time, there have been disruptions in our manufacturing operations as a result of power outages, improperly functioning equipment and facilities, disruptions in supply of raw materials or components, or equipment failures. We have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences and possible climate changes, such as severe and variable weather and geological events resulting in increased costs, or disruptions to our manufacturing operations or those of our suppliers or customers. In addition, climate change may pose physical risks to our manufacturing facilities or our suppliers’ facilities, including increased extreme weather events that could result in supply delays or disruptions. Other events, including political or public health crises, such as an outbreak of contagious diseases, may also affect our production capabilities or that of our suppliers, including as a result of quarantines, closures of production facilities, lack of supplies, or delays caused by restrictions on travel or shipping. Events of the types noted above have occurred from time to time and, because these risks are a characteristic of our business, they may occur in the future. As a result, in addition to disruptions to operations, our insurance premiums may increase or we may not be able to fully recover any sustained losses through insurance. 46 Table of Contents If production is disrupted for any reason, manufacturing yields may be adversely affected, or we may be unable to meet our customers’ requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers. This could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs, loss of revenue, or damage to customer relationships, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. A significant portion of our revenue is concentrated with certain customers and end markets. In the first six months of 2025, over half of our total revenue came from our top ten customers. On end markets, approximately one-half of our total revenue was concentrated in the data center end market. A disruption in our relationship with any of our top customers or a significant decrease in demand for our data center products, or in the overall data center end market, could adversely affect our business. We could experience fluctuations in our customer base or the mix of revenue by customer or end market, as markets and strategies evolve. Demand for our products may fluctuate due to factors beyond our control. Our inability to qualify our products to meet customer or end market requirements could adversely impact our revenue. A meaningful change in inventory strategy by our top customers or in certain end markets could impact our industry bit demand growth outlook. In addition, any consolidation of our customers or consolidation of significant end markets could limit the opportunity for sale of our products. The loss of, or restrictions on our ability to sell to, one or more of our major customers or in certain end markets, or any significant reduction in orders or a shift in product mix, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. See “Part I. Financial Information – Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Certain Concentrations.” Increases in sales of system solutions may increase our dependency upon specific customers and our costs to develop, qualify, and manufacture our system solutions. Our development of system-level memory and storage products is dependent, in part, upon successfully identifying and meeting our customers’ specifications for those products. Developing and manufacturing system-level products with specifications unique to a customer increases our reliance upon that customer for purchasing our products at sufficient volumes and prices in a timely manner. Even if our products meet customer specifications, our sales of system-level solutions are dependent upon our customers choosing our products over those of our competitors and purchasing our products at sufficient volumes and prices. Our competitors’ products may be less costly, provide better performance, or include additional features when compared to our products. Our long-term ability to sell system-level memory and storage products is reliant upon our customers’ ability to create, market, and sell their products containing our system-level solutions at sufficient volumes and prices in a timely manner. If we fail to successfully develop and market system-level products, our business, results of operations, or financial condition may be materially adversely affected. Manufacturing system-level solutions, such as SSDs, managed NAND, and HBM, typically results in higher per-unit manufacturing costs and longer cycle time as compared to other products. Even if we are successful in selling system-level solutions to our customers in sufficient volume, we may be unable to generate sufficient profit if our per-unit manufacturing costs are not offset by higher per-unit selling prices. Manufacturing system-level solutions to customer specifications requires a longer development cycle, as compared to discrete products, to design, test, and qualify, which may increase our costs. Some of our system-level solutions are increasingly dependent on sophisticated firmware that may require significant customization to meet customer specifications, which increases our costs and time to market. Additionally, we may need to update our controller and hardware design as well as our firmware or develop new firmware as a result of new product introductions or changes in customer specifications and/or industry standards, which increases our costs. System complexities and extended warranties for system-level products could also increase our warranty costs. Our failure to cost-effectively manufacture system-level solutions and/or controller, hardware design, and firmware in a timely manner may result in reduced demand for our system-level products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 47 | 2025 Q2 10-Q Table of Contents Products that fail to meet specifications, are defective, or are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us. Products that do not meet specifications or that contain, or are perceived by our customers to contain, defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. From time to time, we experience problems with nonconforming, defective, or incompatible products after we have shipped such products. In recent periods, we have further diversified and expanded our product offerings, which could potentially increase the chance that one or more of our products could fail to meet specifications in a particular application. Our products and solutions may be deemed fully or partially responsible for functionality in our customers’ products and may result in sharing or shifting of product or financial liability from our customers to us for costs incurred by the end user as a result of our customers’ products failing to perform as specified. In addition, if our products and solutions perform critical functions in our customers’ products or are used in high-risk consumer end products, such as autonomous driver assistance programs, home and enterprise security, smoke and noxious gas detectors, medical monitoring equipment, or wearables for child and elderly safety, our potential liability may increase. We could be adversely affected in several ways, including the following: • we may be required or agree to compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible products and to replace products; • we could incur a decrease in revenue or adjustment to pricing commensurate with the reimbursement of such costs or alleged damages; and • we may encounter adverse publicity, which could cause a decrease in sales of our products or harm our reputation or relationships with existing or potential customers. Any of the foregoing items could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Breaches of our security systems or products, systems failures, interruptions, delays in service, catastrophic events, and resulting interruptions in the availability of our systems or those of our customers, suppliers, or business partners, could expose us to losses. We maintain a system of controls over the physical security of our facilities. We also manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations. In addition, we process, store, and transmit data relating to our customers and employees, including sensitive personal information. Unauthorized persons, employees, former employees, nation states, or other parties may gain access to our facilities or technology infrastructure and systems through fraudulent means and may steal trade secrets or other proprietary information, compromise confidential information, create system disruptions, or have other impacts. This risk is exacerbated as competitors for talent, particularly engineering talent, attempt to hire our employees. Through cyberattacks on technology infrastructure and systems, unauthorized parties may obtain access to computer systems, networks, and data, including cloud-based platforms. Our technology infrastructure and systems and that of our suppliers, vendors, service providers, cloud solution providers, and partners have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, such attacks, which could impact our operations. Cyberattacks can include ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, zero-day attacks, supply chain attacks, “phishing” and other forms of social engineering, exploitation of open source software vulnerabilities, and other malicious software programs or other attacks, including those using techniques that change frequently or may be disguised or difficult to detect, or designed to remain dormant until a triggering event, impersonation of authorized users, and efforts to discover and exploit any design flaws, “bugs,” security vulnerabilities, as well as intentional or unintentional acts by employees or other insiders with access privileges. The emergence and maturation of AI capabilities may also lead to new and/or more sophisticated methods of attack. Globally, cyberattacks are increasing in number and the attackers are increasingly organized and well-financed, or supported by state actors, and are developing increasingly sophisticated systems to not only attack, but also to evade detection. In addition, geopolitical tensions or conflicts may create a heightened risk of cyberattacks. Breaches of our physical security, including break-ins, sabotage or vandalism, attacks on our technology infrastructure and systems, security breaches or incidents, or attacks on our customers, suppliers, or business partners who maintain or otherwise process confidential or sensitive information regarding us and our customers and suppliers, could result in damage to, or loss, disruption, or unavailability of data or systems, or inappropriate disclosure, destruction, loss, or other processing of confidential or sensitive information. In addition, our systems and those of our third-party vendors may experience service interruptions, data loss or compromise and outages, for other reasons, including human error, pandemics, fires, other natural disasters, 48 Table of Contents power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks and other geopolitical unrest, computer viruses, ransomware, and other malicious software, changes in social, political, or regulatory conditions or in laws and policies, or other changes or events. Any such event, or the perception it has occurred, may result in significant losses and damage our reputation with customers and suppliers and may expose us to claims, demands, and litigation. Our products and the systems and applications that incorporate or otherwise utilize our products are also targets for cyberattacks. While some of our products contain encryption, security algorithms, or features designed to help protect third-party content, user-generated data stored on our products, or the functionality of our products as intended, systems and applications that utilize these products could be compromised, breached, or circumvented by motivated attackers. Further, our products contain sophisticated hardware, firmware and software (some of which is provided by third parties) that may contain weaknesses or defects in design or manufacture, including “bugs” and other problems that could interfere with the intended operation of our products or be potentially exploited by such attackers. If systems or applications that utilize our products experience a cyberattack, our products are attacked, or our suppliers are breached or attacked, this could harm our business by requiring us to employ additional resources to remediate the errors or defects, and could expose us to litigation, claims, and harm to our reputation. We cannot be certain that any applicable insurance coverage we maintain will be adequate or otherwise protect us with respect to claims, expenses, fines, penalties, business loss, data loss, litigation, regulatory actions, or other impacts arising from security breaches or incidents, or that such coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or at all. Any of the foregoing security risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. We may be adversely impacted by any of the multiple uncertainties and outcomes associated with the use and evolution of AI. We are increasingly incorporating AI capabilities into the development of technologies and our business operations, and into our products and services. AI technology is complex and rapidly evolving, and may expose us to significant competitive, legal, regulatory, and other risks. The implementation of AI can be costly and there is no guarantee that our use of AI will enhance our technologies, benefit our business operations, or produce products and services that are preferred by our customers. AI will likely increase or change the competitive environment in our markets. Our competitors may be more successful in their AI strategy or they may have access to greater AI resources or technology and develop superior products and services. Additionally, AI algorithms or training methodologies may be flawed, and datasets may contain irrelevant, insufficient or biased information, which can cause errors in outputs. AI is also the subject of an evolving set of legal requirements and regulations and we may be subject to new and conflicting laws and regulations. Any of these matters may give rise to legal liability, damage our reputation, and materially harm our business. We must attract, retain, and motivate highly skilled employees. To remain competitive, we must maintain a highly skilled, global workforce and effectively manage succession for key roles. Hiring, retaining, and motivating qualified executives and other skilled talent is critical to our business and competition can be intense. If our total compensation programs, employment benefits, and workplace culture are not viewed as competitive and inclusive, our ability to attract and retain talent could be compromised. At times, we experience higher levels of attrition and more intense competition for talent across our industry, which can lead to increased compensation costs. To the extent we experience significant attrition and are unable to timely replace employees, we could experience a loss of critical skills and reduced employee morale, potentially resulting in business disruptions, inefficiencies during transitional periods and increased expenses. Additionally, changes to immigration policies in the countries in which we operate, as well as restrictions on travel due to public health crises or other causes, may limit our ability to hire and/or retain talent in, or transfer talent to, specific locations. Our business success is dependent on our ability to attract, retain and motivate key talent. Our inability to do so could inhibit our ability to maintain or expand our business operations and may adversely impact our operating results. 49 | 2025 Q2 10-Q Table of Contents Compliance with responsible sourcing requirements and any related regulations could increase our operating costs or limit the supply and increase the cost of certain materials, supplies, and services, and if we fail to comply, customers may reduce purchases from us or disqualify us as a supplier. We and many of our customers have adopted responsible sourcing programs that require us to meet certain sustainability, governance, or other criteria, and to periodically report on our performance against these requirements, including that we source the materials, supplies, and services we use and incorporate into the products we sell as prescribed by these programs. Many customer programs require us to remove a supplier within a prescribed period if such supplier ceases to comply with prescribed criteria, and our supply chain may at any time contain suppliers at risk of being removed due to non-compliance with responsible sourcing requirements. Some of our customers may elect to disqualify us as a supplier (resulting in a permanent or temporary loss of sales to such customer) or reduce purchases from us if we are unable to verify that our performance or products (including the underlying supply chain) meet the specifications of our customers’ responsible sourcing programs on a continuous basis. Meeting responsible sourcing requirements may increase operating requirements and costs or limit the sourcing and availability of some of the materials, supplies, and services we use, particularly when the availability of such materials, supplies, and services is concentrated to a limited number of suppliers. From time to time, we remove suppliers or require our suppliers to remove suppliers from their supply chains based on our responsible sourcing requirements or customer requirements, and we or our suppliers may be unable to replace such removed suppliers in a timely or cost-effective manner. Any inability to replace removed suppliers in a timely or cost effective manner may affect our ability and/or the cost to obtain sufficient quantities of materials, supplies, and services necessary for the manufacture of our products. Our inability to replace suppliers we have removed in a timely or cost-effective manner or comply with customers’ responsible sourcing requirements or with any related regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Evolving sustainability and governance expectations or standards or failure to achieve our related goals could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or stock price. In recent years, there has been an increased focus from stakeholders on sustainability and governance matters, including greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related risks, carbon-free electricity, water stewardship, waste management, inclusion, responsible sourcing and supply chain, and human rights. We actively manage these issues and have established and publicly announced certain sustainability goals, commitments, and targets which we may refine or modify further in the future. These goals, commitments, and targets reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. Achieving these goals may entail significant costs, for example we have entered into several virtual power purchase agreements to obtain renewable energy credits at a cost that will vary based on future prices for electrical power. Evolving stakeholder expectations and our efforts to manage these issues, report on them, and accomplish our goals present numerous operational, regulatory, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks, any of which could have a material adverse impact, including on our reputation and stock price. Such risks and uncertainties include: • reputational harm, including damage to our relationships with customers, suppliers, investors, governments, or other stakeholders; • adverse impacts on our ability to manufacture and sell products and maintain our market share; • the success of our collaborations with third parties; • loss of business due to failure to meet our customers’ sustainability targets; • increased risk of litigation, investigations, or regulatory enforcement action; • unfavorable sustainability and governance ratings or investor sentiment; • diversion of resources and increased costs to control, assess, and report on sustainability and governance metrics; • our ability to achieve our goals, commitments, and targets within timeframes announced; • increased costs to achieve our goals, commitments, and targets; • unforeseen operational and technological difficulties; • access to and increased cost of capital; and • adverse impacts on our stock price. 50 Table of Contents Opinions, perspectives, and expectations on sustainability and governance matters may differ amongst our stakeholders and may evolve over time. We have been and may continue to be subject to conflicting expectations and views on various matters, and legal requirements and interpretations may change. Any failure, or perceived failure, to meet evolving stakeholder expectations and industry standards or achieve our sustainability and governance goals, commitments, and targets could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or stock price. Acquisitions and/or alliances involve numerous risks. Acquisitions and the formation or operation of alliances, such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements, involve numerous risks, including the following: • integrating the operations, technologies, and products of acquired or newly formed entities into our operations; • increasing capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain facilities; • increased debt levels; • the assumption of unknown or underestimated liabilities; • the use of cash to finance a transaction, which may reduce the availability of cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures, R&D expenditures, and other business activities; • diverting management’s attention from daily operations; • managing larger or more complex operations and facilities and employees in separate and diverse geographic areas; • hiring and retaining key employees; • requirements imposed by government authorities in connection with the regulatory review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures, imposition of significant obligations, or restrictions on the conduct of our business or the acquired business; • underestimating the costs or overestimating the benefits, including product, revenue, cost and other synergies and growth opportunities that we expect to realize, and we may not achieve those benefits; • failure to maintain customer, vendor, and other relationships; • inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company’s internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, compliance programs, and/or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices; and • impairment of acquired intangible assets, goodwill, or other assets as a result of changing business conditions or technological advancements. The global memory and storage industry has experienced consolidation and may continue to consolidate. We engage, from time to time, in discussions regarding potential acquisitions and similar opportunities. To the extent we are successful in completing any such transactions, we could be subject to some or all of the risks described above. Acquisitions of, or alliances with, technology companies are inherently risky and may not be successful and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. We may incur restructure charges in future periods and may not realize expected savings or other benefits from restructure plans. From time to time, we have because of the nature of our business, and may in the future, enter into restructure initiatives in order to, among other items, streamline our operations, increase our synergies, respond to changes in business conditions, our markets, or product offerings, or to centralize certain key functions. We may not realize expected savings or other benefits from future restructure activities and may incur additional restructure charges or other losses in future periods associated with other initiatives. In connection with any restructure initiatives, we could incur restructure charges, loss of production output, loss of key personnel, disruptions in our operations, difficulties in the timely delivery of products, and loss of customers and local market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 51 | 2025 Q2 10-Q Table of Contents Risks Related to Intellectual Property and Litigation We may be unable to protect our intellectual property or retain key employees who are knowledgeable of and develop our intellectual property. We maintain a system of controls over our intellectual property, including U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, licensing arrangements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with employees, consultants, and vendors, and a general system of internal controls. Despite our system of controls over our intellectual property, it may be possible for our current or future competitors to obtain, copy, use, or disclose, illegally or otherwise, our product and process technology or other proprietary information. The laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same degree as do U.S. laws, and our confidentiality, non-disclosure, and non-compete agreements may be unenforceable or difficult and costly to enforce. The use of AI in the development of our products and services could also cause loss of intellectual property, as well as subject us to risks related to intellectual property infringement or misappropriation. Additionally, our ability to maintain and develop intellectual property is dependent upon our ability to attract, develop, and retain highly skilled employees. If our competitors or future entrants into our industry are successful in hiring our employees, they may directly benefit from the knowledge these employees gained while they were under our employment, and this may also negatively impact our ability to maintain and develop intellectual property. Our inability to protect our intellectual property or retain key employees who are knowledgeable of and develop our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Legal, regulatory and administrative investigations, inquiries, proceedings, and claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. From time to time, we are subject to various legal, regulatory and administrative investigations, inquiries, proceedings, and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business or otherwise, both domestically and internationally. Such claims, investigations, inquiries, and proceedings may include, but are not limited to, allegations of anticompetitive conduct and infringement of intellectual property. See “Part I. Financial Information – Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Contingencies.” We may be associated with and subject to litigation, claims, inquiries, investigations, or disputes arising from, or as a result of: • our relationships with vendors or customers, supply agreements, or contractual obligations with our subcontractors or business partners; • the actions of our vendors, subcontractors, or business partners; • our indemnification obligations, including obligations to defend our customers against third-party claims asserting infringement of certain intellectual property rights, which may include patents, trademarks, copyrights, or trade secrets; and • the terms of our product warranties or from product liability claims. As we continue to focus on developing system solutions with manufacturers of consumer products, including autonomous driving, augmented reality, humanoid robots, AI, and others, we may be exposed to greater potential for personal liability claims against us as a result of consumers’ use of those products. We, our officers, or our directors have been and could continue to be subject to claims of alleged violations of securities laws. Expansion of our production capacity is subject to inherent safety risks for our employees and contractors. Expansion and renovation activities may involve accidents, which could result in project delays, litigation, claims or disputes by our contractors and others, as well as increased insurance costs. While the risks of our construction projects are covered by insurance and contractual indemnities from our contractors, we may not have insurance coverage or rights to indemnity for all risks. Further, there can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities, and we may elect to self-insure with respect to certain matters. 52 Table of Contents Exposures to various legal proceedings and claims, with or without merit, could require significant attention from our management and could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend claims, are required to pay damage awards, or enter into settlement agreements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Claims that our products or manufacturing processes infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others, or failure to obtain or renew license agreements covering such intellectual property, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. As is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries, from time to time others have asserted, and may in the future assert, that our products or manufacturing processes infringe upon, misappropriate, misuse, or otherwise violate their intellectual property rights. We are unable to predict the outcome of these assertions made against us. Any of these types of claims, regardless of the merits, could subject us to significant costs to defend or resolve such claims and may consume a substantial portion of management’s time and attention. As a result of these claims, we may be required to: • pay significant monetary damages, fines, royalties, or penalties; • enter into license or settlement agreements covering such intellectual property rights; • make material changes to or redesign our products and/or manufacturing processes; and/or • cease manufacturing, having made, selling, offering for sale, importing, marketing, or using products and/or manufacturing processes in certain jurisdictions. We may not be able to take any of the actions described above on commercially reasonable terms and any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. See “Part I. Financial Information – Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Contingencies.” We have a number of intellectual property license agreements. Some of these license agreements require us to make one-time or periodic payments. We may need to obtain additional licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future. We are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on terms acceptable to us. The failure to obtain or renew licenses as necessary could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Risks Related to Laws and Regulations Government actions and regulations, such as export restrictions, tariffs, and trade protection measures, may limit our ability to sell our products to certain customers or markets, or could otherwise restrict our ability to conduct operations. International trade disputes, geopolitical tensions, and military conflicts have led, and continue to lead, to new and increasing export restrictions, trade barriers, tariffs, and other trade measures, as well as retaliatory actions, that can increase our manufacturing costs, make our products less competitive, reduce demand for our products, limit our ability to sell to certain customers or markets, limit our ability to procure, or increase our costs for, components or raw materials, impede or slow the movement of our goods across borders, impede our ability to perform R&D activities, or otherwise restrict our ability to conduct operations. Government actions in the United States or abroad may lead to further changes in trade policy, domestic sourcing initiatives, increases in foreign government incentives supporting domestic businesses or other formal and informal measures that could make it more difficult to sell our products in, or restrict our access to, some markets and/or customers. For example, following the May 2023 decision of its cybersecurity review of our products sold in China, the CAC determined that critical information infrastructure operators in China may not purchase Micron products, impacting our revenue with companies headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong, including direct sales as well as indirect sales through distributors. Further actions by the Chinese government, through CAC action or other means, could impact revenue inside or outside China, or our operations in China, or our ability to ship products to our customers, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 53 | 2025 Q2 10-Q Table of Contents We cannot predict what actions may be taken with respect to export regulations, tariffs, or other trade regulations between the United States and other countries, what products or companies may be subject to such actions, or what actions may be taken by other countries in retaliation. Further changes in trade policy, tariffs, restrictions on exports or other trade barriers, or restrictions on supplies, equipment, and raw materials including rare earth minerals, may limit our ability to produce products, increase our selling and/or manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies. For example, increasing geopolitical tensions have in the past and could in the future result in new export controls associated with products, including those that support or enable AI applications, which could, in turn, restrict future sales of certain products to China or other markets. Such changes may also result in reputational harm to us, the development or adoption of technologies that compete with our products, long-term changes in global trade and technology supply chains, or negative impacts on our customers’ products which incorporate our solutions. Any of the effects described in this risk factor could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. The technology industry is subject to intense media, political, and regulatory scrutiny, which can increase our exposure to government investigations, legal actions, and penalties. Although we have policies, controls, and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, or agents will not violate such laws or our policies. Violations of trade laws, restrictions, or regulations can result in fines; criminal sanctions against us or our officers, directors, or employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. Tax-related matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes and cash tax liabilities in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including changes in the geographic mix of our earnings among jurisdictions, challenges by tax authorities to our tax positions and intercompany transfer pricing arrangements, failure to meet performance obligations with respect to tax incentive agreements, expanding our operations in various countries, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, adverse resolution of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns, and changes in tax laws and regulations. Changes to income tax laws and regulations, or the interpretation of such laws, in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could significantly increase our effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flows from operating activities and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project, including Pillar Two Model Rules (“Pillar Two”), undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”). Nearly all European Union member states have enacted the Pillar Two legislation, which will be effective for us in 2025. We do not expect these enacted laws to materially impact our effective tax rate for 2025. On November 27, 2024, Singapore enacted legislation to implement Pillar Two, which will apply to us starting in 2026. While we are still evaluating the impacts, we expect our effective tax rate for 2026 to be in the high-teens percentage range. We also continue to monitor for additional guidance and legislative changes related to Pillar Two in the jurisdictions where we operate. We and others are subject to a variety of complex and evolving laws, regulations, or industry standards, including with respect to environmental, health, safety, and product considerations, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. The manufacture of our products requires the use of facilities, equipment, chemicals, and materials that are subject to a broad array of laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions in which we operate. This includes increasing regulations on a class of chemicals known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Additionally, we are subject to a variety of other laws and regulations relative to the construction, maintenance, and operations of our facilities. Any changes in laws, regulations, or industry standards could cause us to incur additional direct costs, as well as increased indirect costs related to our relationships with our customers and suppliers, and otherwise harm our operations and financial condition. Any failure to comply with laws, regulations, or industry standards could adversely impact our reputation and our financial results. Additionally, we engage various third parties as sales channel partners or to represent us or otherwise act on our behalf who are also subject to a broad array of laws, regulations, and industry standards. Our engagement with these third parties may also expose us to risks associated with their respective compliance with laws and regulations. 54 Table of Contents New and evolving environmental, health, safety, and product considerations, including those related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, the purchase, use and disposal of regulated and/or hazardous chemicals, and the potential resulting environmental, health or safety impacts, may result in new laws, regulations, or industry standards that may affect us, our suppliers, and our customers. Such laws, regulations, or industry standards could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers, or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. New and evolving laws and regulations relating to cybersecurity, data privacy, and AI impose requirements for information confidentiality, integrity, availability, personal and proprietary data collection, storage, use, sharing, deletion, and AI systems to be appropriately transparent, fair, secure, beneficial, and accountable. Along with these, such laws, standards, and market expectations could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers, or partners reluctance to share information or solutions due to actual or perceived inadequate controls. These costs may adversely impact our operations and financial condition. As a result of the considerations detailed in this risk factor, we could experience the following: • suspension of production or sales of our products; • limited supplies of chemicals or materials used to make our products; • remediation costs and activities; • increased compliance costs; • alteration of our manufacturing processes; • regulatory penalties, fines, civil or criminal sanctions, and other legal liabilities; and • reputational challenges. Compliance with, or our failure, or the failure of our third-party sales channel partners or agents, to comply with, laws, regulations, or industry standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Risks Related to Capitalization and Financial Markets We may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations, make scheduled debt payments, pay our dividend, and make adequate capital investments. Our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory and storage products sold, average selling prices, and manufacturing costs. To develop new product and process technology, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality, we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology, capital equipment, facilities, R&D, and product and process technology. We estimate capital expenditures in 2025 for property, plant, and equipment, net of proceeds from government incentives, to be approximately $14 billion. In the past, we have utilized external sources of financing when needed. As a result of our debt levels, expected debt amortization, prevailing interest rates, and general capital market and other economic conditions, it may be difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. We have experienced volatility in our cash flows and operating results and we expect to continue to experience such volatility in the future, which may negatively affect our credit rating. Our credit rating may also be affected by our liquidity, financial results, economic risk, or other factors, which may increase the cost of borrowings and make it difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. There can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows, access capital or credit markets, or find other sources of financing to fund our operations, make debt payments, refinance our debt, pay our quarterly dividend, and make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency. Our inability to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 55 | 2025 Q2 10-Q Table of Contents Debt obligations could adversely affect our financial condition. We have incurred in the past, and expect to incur in the future, debt to finance our capital investments, business acquisitions, and to realign our capital structure. As of February 27, 2025, we had debt with a carrying value of $14.36 billion and may incur additional debt. On March 12, 2025, we terminated our $2.50 billion existing undrawn credit facility and entered into a new $3.50 billion Revolving Credit Facility. Our debt obligations could adversely impact us as follows: • require us to use a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on debt, which will reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund our business activities; • adversely impact our credit rating, which could increase borrowing costs and reduce our ability to raise funds on favorable terms; • limit our future ability to raise funds for capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, R&D, and other general corporate requirements; • restrict our ability to incur specified indebtedness, create or incur certain liens, and enter into sale-leaseback financing transactions; • increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; • increase our exposure to rising interest rates from variable rate indebtedness; and • result in certain of our debt instruments becoming immediately due and payable or being deemed to be in default if applicable cross default, cross-acceleration and/or similar provisions are triggered. Our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flows or obtain external financing in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to market, economic, financial, competitive, legislative, and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that additional capital will be available to us, in amounts sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs. Additionally, events and circumstances may occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy applicable draw-down conditions and utilize our Revolving Credit Facility. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows to service our debt payment obligations or satisfy our debt covenants, we may need to refinance, restructure, or amend the terms of our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Across our global operations, significant transactions and balances are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (our reporting currency), primarily the Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, euro, Indian rupee, Japanese yen, Malaysian ringgit, New Taiwan dollar, and Singapore dollar. In addition, a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in some of the foreign currencies mentioned above. Exchange rates for some of these currencies against the U.S. dollar have been volatile and may be volatile in future periods. If these currencies strengthen against the U.S. dollar, our manufacturing costs could significantly increase. Exchange rates for the U.S. dollar that adversely change against our foreign currency exposures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. We are subject to counterparty default risks. We have numerous arrangements with financial institutions that subject us to counterparty default risks, including cash deposits, investments, and derivative instruments. Additionally, we are subject to counterparty default risk from our customers for amounts receivable from them. As a result, we are subject to the risk that the counterparty will default on its performance obligations. A counterparty may not comply with its contractual commitments which could then lead to its defaulting on its obligations with little or no notice to us, which could limit our ability to mitigate our exposure. Additionally, our ability to mitigate our exposures may be constrained by the terms of our contractual arrangements or because market conditions prevent us from taking effective action. If one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterparty’s default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of such default, we could incur significant losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 56 Table of Contents The trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. Our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, we, the technology industry, and the stock market as a whole have on occasion experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to the specific operating performance of individual companies. The trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely due to various factors, including, but not limited to, actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results, changes in financial forecasts or estimates by us or financial or other market estimates and ratings by securities and other analysts, changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public, interest rate changes, regulatory changes, news regarding our products or products of our competitors, and broad market and industry fluctuations. For these reasons, investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future trading prices of our common stock, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Investors in our common stock may not realize any return on their investment in us and may lose some or all of their investment. Volatility in the trading price of our common stock could also result in the filing of securities class action litigation matters, which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources. The amount and frequency of our share repurchases may fluctuate, and we cannot guarantee that we will purchase all of the shares under our share repurchase authorization, or that it will enhance long-term shareholder value. Share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and will diminish our cash reserves. The amount, frequency, and execution of our share repurchases pursuant to our share repurchase authorization may fluctuate based on our operating results, cash flows, restrictions applicable under our CHIPS Act direct funding agreements, and priorities for the use of cash for other purposes. See “Part I. Financial Information –Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – CHIPS Act Funding Agreements.” Our expenditures for these share repurchases were $300 million in 2024, $425 million in 2023, $2.43 billion in 2022, $1.20 billion in 2021, $176 million in 2020, and $2.66 billion in 2019. These other purposes include, but are not limited to, operational spending, capital spending, acquisitions, and repayment of debt. Other factors, including changes in tax laws, could also impact our share repurchases. Although our Board of Directors has authorized share repurchases of up to $10 billion of our outstanding common stock, the authorization does not obligate us to repurchase any common stock. We cannot guarantee that we will purchase all of the shares under our share repurchase authorization or that it will enhance long-term shareholder value. The repurchase authorization could affect the trading price of our stock and increase volatility, and any announcement of a pause in, or termination of, this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock. In addition, this program is a use of cash, which may reduce the availability of cash for other business purposes, including investments, acquisitions, dividends, or repayment of indebtedness. There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends in any particular amounts or at all. Our Board of Directors has adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which we currently pay a cash dividend on our common shares on a quarterly basis. The declaration and payment of any dividend is subject to the approval of our Board of Directors and our dividend may be discontinued or reduced at any time. There can be no assurance that we will declare cash dividends in the future in any particular amounts, or at all. Future dividends, if any, and their timing and amount, may be affected by, among other factors: our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions, debt service obligations, contractual restrictions, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. A reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock. In addition, the payment of dividends is a use of cash, which may reduce the availability of cash for other business purposes, including investments, acquisitions, or repayment of indebtedness. 57 | 2025 Q2 10-Q Table of Contents ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS In May 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to $10 billion of our outstanding common stock through open-market purchases, block trades, privately-negotiated transactions, derivative transactions, and/or pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date, does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, and is subject to market conditions, restrictions applicable under our CHIPS Act direct funding agreements, and our ongoing determination of the best use of available cash. See “Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – CHIPS Act Funding Agreements.” During the quarter ended February 27, 2025, we did not repurchase any common stock under the authorization and as of February 27, 2025, $2.81 billion of the authorization remained available for the repurchase of our common stock. Shares of common stock withheld as payment of withholding taxes upon the vesting of restricted stock are also treated as common stock repurchases. Shares withheld as payment of withholding taxes upon the vesting of restricted stock units are not considered repurchases for purposes of this Item and are not required to be reported. In the second quarter of 2025, shares withheld as payment upon the vesting of restricted stock consisted of the following: Period Total number of shares purchased Average price paid per share Total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced plans or programs Approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under publicly announced plans or programs (in millions) November 29, 2024 – December 26, 2024 — $ — — December 27, 2024 – January 23, 2025 38,655 101.76 — January 24, 2025 – February 27, 2025 — — — 38,655 — $2,806 ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION Securities Trading Plans of Directors and Executive Officers No directors or officers, as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act, adopted and/or terminated a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or a “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K, during the last fiscal quarter. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 6.
